#####Body#####

1. The Harmony of the WORLD.

    _ Chap. I. Of God and his power in infus•ng of v•rtues and Idea's into things gradually, and how the Soule from God descends into the Body; that the nature of God is as intelligible as the nature of any being whatsoever; th• true notion of his ubiquity, and how intelligible it is, of the Ʋnion of Divine Essence; of the Notion of a Spirit, of the Office and Duty of Spirits, from Sup•riours to •nferiours.

    _ Chap. II. Of the Nature of God and Spirits, how they are intelligible, a plain and Compendious demonstration that Matter consists of parts indiscerpible. An Answer to William Lilly touching his simple conceits and flattering Predictions and Observations. An Apology for the vehicles of Demons and souls separate; of the state of the other life, that it is n t one universal soule that hears, sees and reasons in every man, demonstrated from the Acts of memory, of the spirits of Nature.

    _ Chap. III. That the Idea's of several kindes of Immaterial beings, have no inconsistency, nor incongruity in t•em: of the Idea of God and his Power, of all Finite and Created Spirits: how they are defined of Indiscerpibility: A symbolical representation thereof; an Objection answered against that representation; an Application of principles of the Ʋnion of the secondary substance, considered transversly, that the Idea of a Spirit hath less difficulty than that of Matter; An Answ•r to an Objection from the Rational faculty: Answers to the Hypothesis of Fancy; of the self motion of a Spirit, of self Penetration, of self Contraction and Dilatation, the Power of Penetrating of Matter, The power of moving and of altering the Matter.

    _ Chap. IV. Of the Harmony of the Macrocosme or great World: Of the Order and Nature of it; how the Sun, Moon and Stars receive their Light, and the Heavens their Motions; how they are guided in their several Spheres; and how by their mutual Presence, Absence and various Meetings, the visible Heavens receive the brightnesse of the Spiritual world, and this Earth the brightness of the visible Heavens.

    _ Chap. V. Grounds proving the motion and harmony of the Heavens and Planets, to be by the Angels, that Rule and Conduct them, and not in their power to move themselves, or cast any light, influence, or virtue to one another.

    _ Chap. VI. Of the Harmony of the Aspects of the Planets, and how they do transfer their received Light and Vertue downwards: of Intentions and Remissions by Configuration of Starrs: and how the Light of the Starrs passeth unto all parts, and the Aireall Spirits to us by them.

    _ Chap. VII. Of Seminal forms, of Souls of Brutes; of the soul of Man, and how they differ in Nature one from another, and how the soule of a man differs from an Angel.

    _ Chap. VIII. How different vertues are infused into severall kinds of things, by the influence of the heavens, Starrs and Planets.

    _ Chap. IX. How the Genii are united to their different Vehicles; Of Aetherial and Terrestrial Vehicles. The Duration of the Genii in their several Vehicles necessary for the understanding, how they enter into this Earthy body.

    _ Chap. X. Of the Harmony of the Microcosme, how the Spirit or Genius proportions the body: How the Body agrees with Musick, and of the measure and Number of Members in Man.

    _ Chap. XI. In what part of the body, is the chief seat of the soul; that common sense is seated somwhere in the head, a caution for the choyce of the particular place thereof; that the whole braine is not it, nor any small solid particle, nor any externall membrane of the Braine, nor the Septem Lucidum nor the Conarion, nor that part of the spinall marrow where the Nerves are conceived
 to concurr, but the spirits in the fourth Ventricle of the Braine; that neither the soul without the spirits, nor the spirits without the presence of the Genius in the Organ, are sufficient causes of sensation; how sensation is made; how imagination, of reason and memory; and whether there be any markes in the braine, that the spirits are the imediate instrument of the Genius in memory also; and how memory arises, as also forgetfullness, how spontanious motion is performed; how we walke, sing, and play, though thinking of something else; that though the spirits be not alike every where, yet the sensiferous impression will pass to the common sensorium, that there is a heterogenity in the very s•ul her self, and what it is in her we call the root and centre, and the eye; and what the rayes and branches, that the sober and allowable distribution of her into parts, is into perceptive and plastick.

    _ Chap. XII. Medicines to prolong life; to preserve health; to wax young being old; To continue young: How to change, alter and amend the state of the Body Of Aurum Potabile; Of the Pana•e• Of the Aether; Of the Pantarva: The Water of the Sun; The Water of the Moon; The Blew Tincture and the Fire; The Greene salt and Azure Oyle; Of the red Medicine; Of the Water of the colour of Gold; Of the Oyle of Gold: How to dissolve Mettals.

    _ Chap. XIII. How the Soul or Genius being united to the body continues in Harmony with it: A Comparison betwixt the Soule in the Body, and the Aerial Genii.

    _ Chap. XIV. How the soul separates from the body; and is not stopt in the dead corps, as some would have it? how she can get out of the body, that her Ʋnion with her Aerial Vehicle may be very sudden as it were in a moment? how the soul may be loosned and leave the body, and yet returne to it again by ointments: that souls departed communicate dreams. Apparitions of bodies and unbodied Genii, Of Cap. Lap & Dr. Nic Culpeper appearing after death; How Naturall and Ordinary it is for Genii to appear? Reasons to perswade the unprejudiced that ordinarily those apparitions that bear the shape and person of the deceased, are indeed the souls of them: That the soul is capable of an Aery and Aetherial body,
 as well as a terrestiall; and also of sense, pain, pleasure; Of the genious power of changing the temper: Of her Aereal Vehicle, and the shape thereof; That the vehicles of Genii have as much of soled corporeal substance in them as the bodies of them: That the naturall abode of souls departed after death is the Aire: How Daemons and separate Genii hear and see us at a vast distance, and whence it is that though they may so easily hear or see us, we may neither hear nor see them; Of the Touch, Smell, Taste, and Nourishment of Genii; How they are visible one to another: That they converse in a humane shape the better sort of them; the baser in Bestial; of the Igneous splendours of Genii; How they are made; That the external beauty of the Genii is according to the degree of the inward Vertue of their minds? How Ghosts entertaine one another in the other world; of their conferences P•ilosophicall and politicall; Of their Religious exercises; Of the pastimes and recreations of the better sort; Whence the Aireal Genii have their food; Of the food and feastings of the better sort of Genii.

    _ Chap. XV. That there is a Political Order and Laws amongst the Aiery Daemons; That this Chain of Government reaches down from the highest Aetherial powers, through the Aerial to the very Inhabitants of the Earth; the peculiar feature and individual Character of the Aerial Vehicle; The retainment of the same name: How to finde the Names of Genii: A Table: What kinde of punishments the Aerial Officers inflict upon their Malefactours? What mischeif men may create to themselves in the other World by their zealous mistakes in this, the unspeakable torments of Conscience, worse than death, and not to be avoided by dying: Of the spirit of Nature, what it is? That the sympathy betwixt the Earthy and Astral body argue its existence; The roundnesse of the Sun and Stars prove it: An absolute demonstration of the existence of the Spirit of Nature, its grand Office of transmitting souls into rightly prepared matter: Of the seldome appearing of Spirits; Of the tragical pompe and dreadfull preludes of Death, with some corroborative considerations against such sad spectacles: What may befall the Genius, and the hazards she runs after this
 life; whereby she may again become obnoxious to death: That the Aethereral Vehicle instates the Genius in the everlasting blisse and happinesse, &c.

    _ CHAP. XVI. How the Earth is consumed, and the bodies of the dead, and what becomes of the dust of those that are resolved into their first Principle; that the conflagration of the earth will prove fatal to the souls of the wicked men and Daemons; what the cursed spirits and souls w•ll suffer, and what be their thoughts that do groan in Tophet, when Minos judges them: Eugenius Theodidactus testimony of the Ayreal state, and five s•veral Opinions more concerning their state after the conflagration, that the Sun being turned into darkness, and the Moon into blood, is no panick fear, but may be rationally suspected from the Records of History, and grounds of Natural Phylosophy, the said influence of this extinction upon man and beast, and all the Aireal Genii imprisoned within their s•veral Armospheres in our Vortex, that it will do little or no dammage to the Aethereal Inhabitants, in reference to heat or warmth, nor will they find much want of his light, how they may pass out of one Vortex into another, by the priviledge of their Aetherial Vehicles, without labour or toil, and be safe• that wicked souls and Daemons will revive again, and that the earth and ayr will be inhabited by them.
