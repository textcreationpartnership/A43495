            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN Mr. <hi>Slades</hi> Orchard at <hi>Sidmouth</hi> in <hi>Devon,</hi> about the dawning or <hi>day</hi>-break, being tyred with a tedious soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and those pensive thoughts which attend it, after much losse and more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, I suddenly fell asleep; Here then <hi>day</hi> was no sooner born then strangled: I was reduced to a <hi>night</hi> of more deep Tincture than that which I had formerly spent: My <hi>fancy</hi> placed me in a <hi>Region</hi> of inexpressable obscurity, and as I thought more than Natural, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any terrours; I was in a firm even temper, and though without incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, not onely resolute, but well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: I moved every way for discoveries, but was still entertained with darknesse and silence; and I thought my self trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb facs="tcp:55271:10"/> to the <hi>land of Dessolation.</hi> Being thus troubled to no purpose, and weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with long endeavours, I resolv'd to rest my self; and seeing I could finde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing I expected, if any thing could finde me. I had not long continued in this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; but I could here the whispers of a soft winde, that travell'd towards me; and suddenly it was in the leaves of the Trees, so that I concluded my self upon the south-side <hi>Hewill</hi> upon <hi>Hazle-hill</hi> in <hi>Warwick-shire,</hi> among the shady walks of those woods, wherein often by the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver side, &amp; by the Christal fountain, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lost the sight of the rest of the world, and the world of me; I found out in that hidden solitude very excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent experiments in Medicines, admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble glorious tinctures, and Telesmes in the <hi>Earth,</hi> and the secrets of Nature, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with this breath came the <hi>day-light,</hi> and with it such a <hi>bright flame,</hi> that it seemed to exceed that of the <hi>Sun:</hi> After we had done our holy things at the twentieth
<pb facs="tcp:55271:10"/> houre of the tenth day of <hi>June</hi> 1648. there appeared to us, after their usuall manner; <hi>Seven men cloathed in silk gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with Cloaks after the</hi> English <hi>mode, with purple Stockins, and Crimson Velvet Coats, red and shining on their Breast: nor were they all thus clad, but onely two of them, who were the chief: On the ruddier and taller of these two, other two waited, but the lesse and paler had three attendants:</hi> So that they made up seven in all; they were about forty years of Age, but lookt as if they had not reacht thirty; when they were asked who they were? They answered, that they were <hi>Homines Aerii, Aerial men,</hi> who are born and dye as we; but that their life is much longer then ours, as reaching to three hundred years, and they raise each other from death to life.

                  </gap>?</hi> They answered, <hi>Nihil quod cuique proprium esset superesse;</hi> that they were of a nearer affinity with the <hi>Divi</hi> then we: but yet infinitely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb facs="tcp:55271:11"/> from them: and that their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse or misery, as much transcended ours, as ours does the bruit Beasts; that they knew all things, past, present, or to come, and what is hid, whether Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes or Books; and that the lowest sort of them, were the <hi>Genii</hi> of the best and noblest men amongst the <hi>Rosie Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> as the basest men are the trainers up of the best sort of dogs; that the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity of their bodies was such, that they can neither do us good nor hurt; saving in what they may be able to doe by <hi>spectres</hi> and <hi>terrers,</hi> and impartent of <hi>knowledge,</hi> we asked what Religion was best amongst us? they answered the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant;</hi> and <hi>Episcopacy</hi> was the best <hi>Form of Church Government,</hi> and that they were both publick professors in an <hi>Acca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy,</hi> and that he of the lesser stature had three hundred <hi>Disciples,</hi> the other twenty: we asked further, why they would not reveale such treasures as they knew unto men?

            <p>These <hi>Aireyall Inhabitants,</hi> stayd at least ten hours disputing and arguing of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry things, amongst which, one was <hi>the Originall of the World: The Taller de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying that God made the World, ab aeterno:</hi> The Lesser affirmed that he so created it every moment, that if he should desist but one moment it would perish, <hi>whereupon the other cited some things out of the dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of R.C.

            <p>As these went away from us, there came a most Heavenly Odorous Aire, like that of sweet Bryers, but not so full and ranke, in this admiration were we conveyed I know not how, into the Orchard again; where this Perfume be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blown over, there succeeded a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant humming of Bees, amongst Flowers, Herbs and Leaves that were there, and this did somewhat discompose me, for I Judged it not suitable with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of the place, which was now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain darke and like midnight, then was I somewhat troubled, with these unexpected occurrences; When a new appearance diverted my apprehensions. Not farr off on my right hand, I could discover a white weake light, not so cleere as that of a candle, but misty and much resembling an Atmosphere, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the centers it was of <hi>Purple colour</hi> like the <hi>Elesian sun-shine,</hi> but in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latation of the circumference Milky: And if we consider the joynt Tincture of
<pb facs="tcp:55271:12"/> the parts, it was a <hi>painted Vesper,</hi> a figure of that splendour which the old <hi>Romans</hi> called <hi>Sol mortilorum;</hi> whilest I admired this strange scaene, there appeared in the middle of the <hi>purple colours,</hi> a sudden commotion, and out of their <hi>very centre</hi> did sprout a <hi>certain flowery light,</hi> as it were the <hi>flame</hi> of a <hi>Taper,</hi> very <hi>bright</hi> it was, sparkling and twinckling like the day-Star; the beams of this new Planet issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth in smal skeins and rivilets, lookt like threds of silver, which being reflected against the Trees, discovered a curious green Umbrage; and I found my self in that Mathematical Grove of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring Apple Trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> set by Master <hi>William Slade;</hi> Under this shade and skreen, did lodge a number of Nitin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gales, Thrushes, and Owsels or Black-birds, which first I discovered by their whitish breasts; These peeping through their leavy Cabinets, rejoyced at this strange light, and having first plum'd themselves, stirr'd the still aire with their
<pb facs="tcp:55271:13"/> Musick; these (with many other little birds that streined their pretty throats) which I thought was very pretty, for the silence of the night, suiting with the solitude of the place, made me judge it heavenly: The ground both neer and far off, presented a pleasing kinde of Checquer; for this new Star meeting with some drops of dew, made a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of bright refractions, as if the earth had been paved with Diamonds. These rare and various accidents kept my Soule busied, but to interrupt my thoughts, as if it had been unlawfull to examine what I had seen; another more admirable Object interposed, I I could see between me and the light, a most exquisite <hi>Divine Beauty,</hi> black and lovely, her frame neither long nor short, but a mean decent stature; <hi>Attyred she was</hi> (according to the most <hi>Curious mode of the Country,</hi> at <hi>Sydmouth</hi> in the <hi>County of Devone</hi> near <hi>Exeter,</hi>) In a habit best pleased her own nature, <hi>for she valued
<pb facs="tcp:55271:13"/> not Vanity;</hi> her <hi>Eyes</hi> were quick, fresh and <hi>Celestiall,</hi> but had something of a Start, as if she had been puzzled with a suddain occurrence, her Countenance was Amiable; from her black vaile, did her features break forth, like Sun Beams in a mist, her haire ran dishevelled to her breasts, and returned to her cheeks in curles, and that hayre behind was row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to a curious Globe, with a smal short spire Flowered with <hi>Purple</hi> and <hi>Skie</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured <hi>Knotts,</hi> her <hi>Rings</hi> were pure en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre <hi>Embralds,</hi> for she valued no Mettals, and her <hi>Pendants</hi> of burning <hi>Carbuncles;</hi> To be short, her whole habit was <hi>Youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> and <hi>Flowry,</hi> of <hi>Skie Coloured Silk,</hi> thin and loose, <hi>Fancied with Violet, Silver, White, Blew, Green and Scarlet Ribbands;</hi> which lookt very fine and pleasant in a Golden Morning, and smelt like the East and was throughly aired with rich <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian Diapasms.</hi> But whilst I admired her perfections, and prepared to make my addresses, <hi>she prevents me with a volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb facs="tcp:55271:14"/> approach.</hi> Here indeed I expected some discourse from her, but she look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very seriously and silently in my face <hi>takes me by the hand,</hi> and I thought it not amisse to walk with so sweet a <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> when she so fairely invited me; now the <hi>Light</hi> which I had formerly admired, proved to be her <hi>Attendant:</hi> for it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved like an usher before her. This ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice added much to her Glory, and it was my only care to observe her, who though she wandered not; Yet verily she followed no known path. Her walke was Green, being Furred with a fine small Grasse, which felt like Plush, for it was very foft; and purled all the way with <hi>Dasies, Primroses, Violets, Honey-suckles,</hi> and <hi>sweet flowers;</hi> when we came out of this our <hi>Arborel</hi> or <hi>Courtly Orchard</hi> of <hi>Apple Trees;</hi> I could perceive a strange clearnesse in the <hi>Aire,</hi> not like that of <hi>Day;</hi> neither can I affirm it was <hi>night;</hi> the Stars indeed perched over us, and stood glimmering, as it were on the tops
<pb facs="tcp:55271:14"/> of high hills; for we were in a most deep bottome, betwixt <hi>Corle</hi> and <hi>Bulver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and the <hi>earth</hi> over lookt us; so we walked over a little <hi>Rivolet,</hi> through <hi>my Fathers first, second and third Courts,</hi> and passed the last gate, that directs to a <hi>bridge,</hi> which we went over; and we had not gone very far, when I had a great desire to hear my <hi>Mistresse</hi> speak, (for so I judged her now) that if possible, I might receive some information from her: how to bring this about, I did not well know; For she seem'd very coy, rough and averse from discourse, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving resolv'd with my self to disturb her. I asked if she would favour me with her Name? To which she replyed very familiarly, as if she had known me long before, My true and faithfull Servant (said she) my Name is <hi>Beata;</hi> you do here behold, <hi>The Harmony of the World, Man, the Soul, Nature</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> and had it been your fortune barely to know the secrets of <hi>Nature, Reason</hi> and <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:55271:15"/> with all the sweet circumstances of them, which few upon Earth understand, I would not have been your <hi>Mistris:</hi> and now my dearly beloved Servant J.H. pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish this <hi>Rosie Crucian</hi> mistery, and add it to your former discourses, <hi>viz.

<pb facs="tcp:55271:15"/> them know by the <hi>Rosie Crucian M</hi> that there are but two <hi>Elements, Earth and VVater,</hi> Air is the Caement of two worlds and a Medly of Extreams. It is natures common place, her index, where you may finde all that ever she did or intends to do; This is the Worlds <hi>Rendezvous;</hi> in this are innumerable <hi>Idea's</hi> of Men, Beasts, Fish and Foul, Trees, Herbs, and all creeping things, this is <hi>Mare Rerum invisibilium,</hi> for all the conceptions <hi>in sinu superioris naturae,</hi> wrap themselves in this Tiffany, before they imbarke in the shell. It retayns the species of all things whatsoever, and is the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate receptacle of spirits, after dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whence they passe to the Aethereal Region, which is a most silent Fire. This Fire passeth through all things in the world, and it is natures Chariot, in this she rides; when she moves this moves, and when she stands this stands, like the Wheels in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> whose Motion depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth on that of the spirit, this is the
<pb facs="tcp:55271:16"/> Mask and Screen of the Almighty, wheresoever he is, this <hi>Train</hi> of <hi>Fire</hi> attends him. Thus he appears to <hi>Moses</hi> in the <hi>Bush,</hi> but it was in Fire; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet sees him break out at the <hi>North,</hi> but like a <hi>Fire</hi> catching it self; at <hi>Horeb</hi> he is attended with a <hi>mighty strong wind</hi> rending the Rocks in pieces, but after this comes the <hi>Fire,</hi> and with it a still small voice, <hi>Esdras</hi> also defines a God, whose service is conversant in <hi>VVinde</hi> and <hi>Fire;</hi> this face is the vestment of the <hi>Divine Majesty,</hi> his back parts which he shewed to <hi>Moses,</hi> but his naked roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Essence none can see and live; The Glory of his presence would swallow up the naturall man, and make him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together spiritual, thus <hi>Moses</hi> his face after conference with him shines, and from his smal <hi>Tincture</hi> you may guess at you future estate in the regeneration, for to know nothing is life eternal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all invisibles came out of the invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="tcp:55271:16"/> God, &amp; this is <hi>The way to bliss;</hi> when you come to the <hi>Chaos</hi> you shall find it <hi>blood red,</hi> because the Central Sulphur presents it so; in your preparation it is white like <hi>Quick-silver,</hi> &amp; transparent like the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, &amp; before the fall of man, there was a more plentifull and large Communion between <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth, God</hi> and the <hi>Elements,</hi> than there is now in your days upon mans transgression; <hi>Malcuth</hi> was cut off from the <hi>Han,</hi> so that a breach was made between both worlds, and their Chanel of <hi>Influences</hi> discontinued. Now <hi>Malcuth</hi> is the invisible <hi>Archetypal Moon,</hi> by which your visible <hi>Caelestial Moon</hi> is governed, and impregnated, and <hi>God</hi> to punish the sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> withdrew himself from the creatures; so that they were not feasted with the same measure of influences as formerly. But the Angels became Ministers of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and the <hi>Law</hi> was in their hands, till <hi>Christ</hi> should take it into his own, and <hi>Raziel</hi> the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel</hi> was presently dispatched to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate

<pb facs="tcp:55271:17"/> in the Magicall Analysis of bodies: For he that knows how to immitate the protochimistry of the Spirit, by separation of the principles, wherein the life is imprisoned, may see the impresse of it experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally in the outward naturall vesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: when the Unity of the Trinity had applyed themselves to the matter, there was extracted from the bosome of it a <hi>thin spirituall celestial substance</hi> w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> receiving a tincture of heat &amp; light proceeding from the divine Treasuries, became a pure sincere innoxious fire, of this the <hi>Bodyes of Angels Consist,</hi> as also the <hi>Empyreall Heaven,</hi> where intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all essences have their residence: this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract being thus setled above, and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the Masse, retaynd in it a vast portion of light, and made the first day without a <hi>Sun,</hi> but the splendour of the word expelling the darkness down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, it became more setled, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact towards the centre, and made a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible

<pb facs="tcp:55271:19"/> must know every <hi>Element</hi> is threefold, for example, there is a threefold earth: First, there is <hi>Terra Elementaris:</hi> then there is <hi>Terra Caelestis,</hi> and lastly <hi>Terra Spiritualis,</hi> the influences of the spiritual earth by mediation of the Celestial, are united to the terrestrial, &amp; are the cause of life, &amp;c. These three are the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalls of art and nature, the first an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to <hi>God the Father,</hi> being the natural foundation of the creature: the second principle is the infallible Magnet, the Mistery of Union, by this all things may be attracted whether Phisicall or meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisical, be the distance never so great, this is <hi>Jacabs Ladder</hi> without this, there is no ascent, or descent either influenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all or personall, this answers <hi>to God the Son,</hi> for it is that which mediates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween extreams, and makes <hi>inferiours</hi> and superiours communicate: the third Principle is not <hi>ex quo,</hi> but <hi>per quod om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> this can do all in all, and the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereof, I may not tell you; it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
<pb facs="tcp:55271:19"/> to the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and amongst na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalls it is the only Agent and Artificer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and by these you may performe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous things; for there is not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound in all nature, but hath in it a little <hi>Sun</hi> and a little <hi>Moon,</hi> and what offices soever the two great Luminaries perform for the conservation of the great world in generall, these two little Luminaries performe the like for the conservation of their Microcosme in particular; the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> are two principles, the one <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,</hi> the other <hi>passive,</hi> this masculine that faeminine, they have Spirits and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels attending them as all bodies have, and the Starrs likewise have spirits that carry influence to one another and to the Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as the great world consists of three parts, the Elementall, the Caelestiall and the Spirituall, above all which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self is seated in that infinite inaccessible light, which streams from his own nature, even so Man hath in him his <hi>Earthly Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
<pb facs="tcp:55271:20"/> parts,</hi> together with the <hi>Celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and Angelicall natures;</hi> in the Centre of all which moves, and shines the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit,</hi> the Sensuall, Caelestial, Aethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial part of man, is that whereby we do move, see, feel, tast and smell, and have a Commerce with all materiall objects whatsoever, it is the same in us as in Beasts, and it is derived from Heaven, where it is predominant to all the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Earthly creatures, it is <hi>Anima Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,</hi> vulgarly called by <hi>Astrologers, Anima Media,</hi> because the influences of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature are conveyed through it to the more materiall parts of the creature, with which of themselves they have no proportion; by means of this <hi>anima me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> or the aetheriall Nature, man is made subject to the <hi>influence of Stars,</hi> and is disposed of, partly by the <hi>Caelestiall Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony;</hi> for this middle spirit is of a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full insinuating nature, and carryes such a strange desire to multiply it self, that the Caelestiall forme stirs up, and excites
<pb facs="tcp:55271:20"/> the Elementall; as is manifest in those Herbs which open at the rising, and shut towards the Sun set, which motion is caused by the Spirit being sensible of the approach and departure of the Sun, for indeed the flowers are as it were the spring of the spirit, where it breaks forth and streams, as it appears by the sweet smells that are most caelestiall, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable there. Again this is more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the plantanimalls, as the vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lamb, the Arbor <hi>Casta,</hi> and severall others; but this will not sink with any, but such as have seen this spirit separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from his elements, <hi>where I leave it for this time:</hi> Next, to this sensuall nature of man, is the Angelical, or Rationall spirit, this spirit adheres somtimes to the <hi>mens</hi> or superiour portion of the soul, &amp; then it is filled with the Divine light; but most commonly it descends into the aethereal, inferior portion, which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>Homo Animalis,</hi> where it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by the <hi>Caelestiall influences,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versly
<pb facs="tcp:55271:21"/> distracted with the irregular <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> and passions of the sensuall nature, above the rationall spirit is the <hi>mens,</hi> commonly called <hi>spiraculum vitarum;</hi> this is that spirit which God breathed into man, and by which man is united again to God; Hence there is in nature a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain spirit which applyes himself to the matter, and Actuates in every generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. That there is also a passive intrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call principle, where he is more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately resident then in the rest, and by mediation of which, he communicates with the more grosse materiall parts, for there is in nature a certain chaine or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate propinquity of complexions between visibles and invisibles, and this is it by which the superiour, spirituall es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senses descend, and converse here below with the matter: do not mistake me Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, I speak not in this place of the Divine spirit, but I speak of a certain Art by which a particular spirit may be united to the universall, and nature by
<pb facs="tcp:55271:21"/> consequence may be strangely exalted and multiplyed. Now then in every frame there are three leading principles, the first is this <hi>Anima</hi> aforesaid, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is called <hi>spiritus mundi,</hi> and this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is the medium <hi>per quod anima infun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditur &amp; movet suum Corpus:</hi> The third is a certain Oleus aetherial water: This is <hi>Menstrum</hi> and <hi>Matrix Mundi,</hi> for in it all things are framed and preserved, as soon as the passive spirit attracts the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nima,</hi> which is done when the first link in the chaine moves, then the aetheriall water in a moment attracts the passive spirit, for this is the first visible recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle wherein the superiour natures are concentrated, and this passive spirit is a thin Aireal substance, the only immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate vestiment wherein the <hi>Anima</hi> wraps her self, when she descends and applyes to generation; the radicall vitall liquor, is a pure caelestiall nature, answering in proportion and complexion to the supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour <hi>inter stellar waters,</hi> the <hi>Soul</hi> being
<pb facs="tcp:55271:22"/> thus confined, by lawfull <hi>Magick,</hi> in this liquid Christall, the light which is in her streams through the water, and then it is <hi>Lux manifesté visibilis ad occulum,</hi> in which state it is first made subject to the Artist: here now lyes the mistery of the <hi>R. C.</hi> his most secret and miraculous py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramid, whose first Unity or Cone is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in <hi>Horizonte Eternitatis,</hi> but his Basis or quadrate is here below in <hi>Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zonte Temporis,</hi> the <hi>Anima</hi> consists of three portions of light, and one of the matter: the Passive spirit hath two parts of the matter and two of the light; wherefore it is called <hi>Natura Media,</hi> and <hi>Sphaera equalitatis,</hi> the Caelestial water hath but one portion of light to three of the matter. Now the chain of descent which concernes the spiritual parts, is grounded on a similitude or Symbol of Nature; and there being but three por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of light in the <hi>Anima,</hi> and two in the passive spirit, the inferiour attracts the superiour; then there being but one
<pb facs="tcp:55271:22"/> portion in the caelestiall nature, and two in the middle spirit; this solitary shining unity attracts the other <hi>Binarious,</hi> to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie and augment its self, as light joynes with light or flame with flame; and thus they hang in a vitall magneticall series. Againe the chain of ascent which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the matter is performed thus: The <hi>Caelestial</hi> nature differs not in substance from the <hi>Aireal Spirit,</hi> but only in degree and complexion, and the <hi>Aireal Spirit</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from the materiall part of the soul in constitution only, and not in nature: so that these three being but one substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, may admit of a perfect Hypostati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Union, and be carried by a certaine intellectuall light in <hi>Horizontem Mundi super supremi,</hi> and so swallowed up of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortallity: thus have I shewed you what you desire, <hi>viz. The Harmony of the World,</hi> how the soul descends and ascends to the body, what the soul of the World is, and what the soul of the Earth, and how the <hi>Primum mobile</hi> sets all a going, you know
<pb facs="tcp:55271:23"/> now the universall spirit of nature, &amp; his strange abstruce miraculous ascent &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent. I shall speak one word more of man &amp; his state after death, and this will prove not a Preface only, but an introduction or a key to the following discourse, &amp; the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of nature even frō God downward.</p>
            <p>And now what I speak of the dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man shall be very brief, because I will close up my discourse, as he doth his life with death, death is <hi>recessus vitae in Absconditum:</hi> not the annihilation of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one principle, but a retreat of hidden natures to the same state they were in, before they were manifested, this is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned by the disproportion and ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of the matter: for when the <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> is broken by the excesse of any one Principle, the vital twist (without a timely reduction of the first vnity) dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands and unravells, In this recesse the severall ingredients of man returne to those severall Elements, from whence they came at first, in their accesse to a
<pb facs="tcp:55271:23"/> compound: thus the earthly parts, as we see by experience, returne to the earth, the Caelestiall to a superiour Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lymbus, and the spirit to God that gave it: and the breathing of it into <hi>Adam,</hi> proves it proceeded from <hi>God;</hi> and <hi>therefore the spirit of God:</hi> Thus <hi>Christ breathed on his Apostles, and they received the Holy Ghost: In</hi> Ezekiel, <hi>The spirit comes from the foure windes, and breathes upon the slain, that they might live.</hi> Now this spirit was a spirit of life, the same with that breath of life, which was breathed into the first man, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a living soul; but without doubt, the breath or spirit of life <hi>is the spirit of God:</hi> Neither is this spirit in man alone, but in all the great world, though after another manner; <hi>For God breathes conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually,</hi> and passeth through all things like an <hi>aire</hi> that refresheth; Hence it is that <hi>God</hi> in Scripture hath several names, now at the dissolution, the principles of man, part, as sometimes friends doe several
<pb facs="tcp:55271:24"/> wayes, <hi>Earth</hi> to <hi>Earth,</hi> and <hi>Heaven</hi> to <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> but the part which is the <hi>Astrall man</hi> hovers sometimes about the <hi>dormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories</hi> of the Dead, and that because of the <hi>Magnetisme</hi> or sympathy, which is between him and the radical vitall moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture: In this <hi>Idolum</hi> is the seat of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and it retains after death an impresse of those Passions and Affections, to which it was subject in the Body: this makes him haunt these places, where the whole man hath been most conversant, and imitate the Actions and Gestures of this life: This Magnetisme is excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confirmed by that <hi>Apparition</hi> in <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark,</hi> so familiarly seen at <hi>noon-day,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering <hi>questions, &amp;c.</hi> But this scoen ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not the Circuit of one year; for when the body begins fully to corrupt, the spirit returns to his original Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: I am now to speak of man as he is subject to a supernatural judgement; and to be short, my Sentinent is this. I conceive there are besides the <hi>Emperial
<pb facs="tcp:55271:24"/> Heaven,</hi> two inferiour Mansions or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles of Spirits. The one is that, which our Saviour cals <gap reason="foreign">

I doe not here main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> or any
<pb facs="tcp:55271:25"/> such painted immaginary <hi>Tophet,</hi> but that which I speak of (if I am not much mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken) I have a strong scripture, for it is that of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> where he speaks of <hi>Christ</hi> being put to death in the flesh, but quickned by the spirit: By which also he went, and preached unto the spirits that were in Prison: which sometimes were disobedient, when once the long suffering of <hi>God</hi> waited in the dayes of <hi>Noah,</hi> while the Arke was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by water. These spirits were the souls of those who perished in the Flood and were reserved in this place till <hi>Christ</hi> should come, and preach repentance to them, and it is not said that the spirit it self precisely preached unto them; but he who went thither by the spirit, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Christ,</hi> in the Hypostaticall Union of His Soul and God-head, which Union was not before the Flood, when these dead did live: again, it is said that he preached unto spirits, not to men: to
<pb facs="tcp:55271:25"/> those which were in prison, not to those which were <hi>in vivis,</hi> and this you may read at large in my <hi>Idea of the Law,</hi> &amp;c. and the Apostle confirms it in another place, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>vers.</hi> 6. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the dead were preached to, not the living, and these spirits were sometimes disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, in the days of <hi>Noah,</hi> whence I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were disobedient at the time of preaching, and this is plain out of the subsequent Chapter, <hi>For this cause was the Gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit:</hi> Now this Judgment in the Flesh was grounded on their disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the days of <hi>Noah,</hi> for which also they were drowned, but Salvation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>God</hi> in the spirit proceeded from their repentance at the preaching of <hi>Christ</hi> which was after <hi>death;</hi> I do not conceive there shall be a Resurrection of every Species; but rather their Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial parts together with the Element of
<pb facs="tcp:55271:26"/> water, (for there shall be no more Sea) shall be united in one mixture with the Earth, and fixed to a pure Diaphanous substance, this is Saint <hi>Johns Christall Gold,</hi> a fundamentall of the new <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> so called, not in the respect of colours but constitution, their spirits at last shall be reduced to their first Lymbus, a sphere of pure aetheriall fire like rich aetheriall Tapestry spread under the <hi>Throne of God:</hi> Neither do I impose this on the Reader, as if I sat in the infalible chaire, but I am confident the Text of it self will speak no other sense; as for the Doctrine it is no way hurtfull, but in my opinion as it detracts not from the mercy of God, so it adds much to the comfort of man; These were her instructions which were no sooner delivered, but she gave me a book curiously wrought and garnished with flourishing <hi>Figures of Golden Hyerogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicks,</hi> with Azure and Silver Letters, saying, I give you leave to be free to those you finde of your own nature, and to

            <p>Again secondly, I have borrowed no mans Authority, but such as is eminent, and quotations I have left out purposely, because I am not controversial, it had been all one labour, to have given you both the Author and place, but it would have troubled the Text, or spotted the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen, which I wish may be free for the

            <p>Now I intreat all ingenious and well disposed Gentlemen, that they would not slight my indeavours, because of my years which are yet but few, It is the custome of most men to measure know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg by the beard, and that they would not conclude any thing rashly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Method of these Books I have written, for they are not easily appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and yet I have spoken as plainly as possible, for the truths of these Arts and Sciences are almost lost, and it is not my happiness to know any man that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands

            <p>To conclude at this time my present discourse, I wish it the common fortune of truth and honesty, to deserve well and hear ill, as for applause, I fish not so much in the Air as to catch it, it is a kinde of popularity, a froth and verball crack in the Pamphlet womens laps in <hi>London</hi> streets, and in Pedlers packs to be seen every day in Almanacks, which makes me scorne it, for I defie the noise of the rout, because they observe not the truth, but the successe of it, I do therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this peice to the world, with the protection of a Gentleman more learned then my self, and the estimat of that soul that understands it, for the rest as I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not force, so I will not beg their appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, I would not be great by Imposts nor rich by briefs, they may be what they will, and I shall be what I am willing to do good to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Artists; and willing to do Justice

               <p>By which kinde of reasoning also, it is easy for the <hi>Psychopannychites</hi> to support their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the sleep of the soul, for the soule being utterly rescinded from all that is Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall, and having no vitall Union there with at all, they will be very prone to infer, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> it is impossible she should know any thing,

               <p>The most common exception I foresee that will be against me, is, that I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon me to describe the Nature and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent of <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Genii</hi> of the other world so punctually and particularly, as if I had been lately amongst them: For over exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitenesse may seem to smell of <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Fraud;</hi> and as there is a diffidency many times in us when we hear something that is extream suitable to our desire, being then most rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to think it too good to be true: So also in Notions that seem over accurately fitted to our intellectual Faculties, and agree the most natural t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:55271:46"/> may seem the lesse credible to some, because it is now made so clearly intelligible, they thinking it utterly improbable that these things, that have been held alwayes such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extricable perplexities, should be thus of a sudden made manifest and Familiar to any that hath but a Competency of patience and Reason to peruse the Theory.</p>
               <p>They that deny my Doctrine and gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all descent of <hi>Spirits</hi> orderly going before, say that there is but one <hi>soule</hi> in the <hi>World,</hi> whose perceptive power is every where.

If the former, they are confutable by sence and experience. For though all ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malls lie steeped, as it were, in that subtle Matter which runs through all things, and is the immediate instrument of sense and perc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55271:47"/> else they would be all <hi>Pythagorians</hi> as well as those I speak of in <hi>The Rosie Crurian, Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Axiomata.</hi> Wherefore we may generally conclude, that if there were such an <hi>Ʋniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Soule,</hi> yet the particular perceptions thereof, are restrained to this or that part in which they are made, which is contrary to the unity of a soul, as I shall tell you in its due place.</p>
               <p>But let us grant the thing (for indeed we have demonstrated it to be so, if there be such an universal soul and none but it) then the grand absurdity comes in, which I was intimating before, <hi>viz</hi> that part of the soul of the world that never perceived a thing, shall notwithstanding remember it, that is to say, that it shall perceive, it hath percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that which it never perceived.</p>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55271:48"/> and irresistably keep out another substance (as matter for example does the parts of matter) as that the parts of another sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance hold so fast together, that they are by no means discerpible, as we have already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated.</p>
               <p>And therefore this holding out in one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as difficult a businesse to conceive, as the holding together of the other, this can be no prejudice to the Notion of a Spirit; For there may be very fast union where we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not at all imagine the Cause thereof, as in such bodies which are exceeding hard, where no man can fancy what holds the parts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether so strongly; and there being no greater difficulty here, than that a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine what holds the parts of a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit together, it will follow, <hi>That, what is plainly and manifestly concluded, ought to be held undeniable, when no difficulties are alledged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, but such as are acknowledged to be found in other conclusions, held by all men undeniably true:</hi> As for example, Suppose one should conclude, <hi>that there may be infinite matter,</hi> or <hi>That there is infinite space,</hi> by very rational Arguments; and that it were objected one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that then the tenth part of the Matter would be infinite; it being most certain, that there is infinite <hi>duration</hi> of something
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55271:49"/> or other in the world; and that the tenth part of this duration is infinite: It is no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ervating at all of the former Conclusion, it being incumbred with no greater incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, than is acknowledged to consist with an undeniable Truth; now the notion of a <hi>Spirit</hi> is not to be excepted against, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous Notion, but is to be admitted for the Notion of a thing that may really exist.</p>
               <p>It may be doubted, whether there may not be <hi>Essences</hi> of a <hi>middle Condition</hi> betwixt these <hi>Corporeal</hi> and <hi>Incorporeal Lights</hi> and <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi> we have described, and that of two sorts; that one <hi>impenetrable</hi> and <hi>discerpible,</hi> the other <hi>penetrable</hi> and <hi>indiscerpible;</hi> but concerning the first, if <hi>impenetrability</hi> be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood in reference to Matter, it is plain there can be no such Essence in the world. And if in reference to its own parts, though it may then look like a possible <hi>Idea</hi> in it self; yet there is no footstep of its existence thereof in Nature, the <hi>souls</hi> of <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> implying contraction and dilatation in them; As for the latter, it has no priviledge for any thing more than matter it self hath, or some mode of matter. For it being discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pible, it is plain its union is by juxtaposition of parts, and the more penetrable, the lesse
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55271:49"/> likely to conveigh sense and motion to any distance; besides, the ridiculous sequel of this supposition, that will fill the Universe with an infinite number of <hi>Shreds</hi> and <hi>Rags</hi> of <hi>Souls</hi> and <hi>Spirits,</hi> never to be reduced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to any use or order.</p>
               <p>And lastly, the proper notion of a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance incorporeal, fully counter distinct to a corporeal substance, necessarily including in it so stronge and indissolvable Union of parts, that it is utterly indiscerpible, when as yet for all that in this general Notion thereof, neither sense nor cogitation is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed; it is most rational to conceive that that substance wherein they are, must assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly be incorporeal in the strictest significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: The Nature of Cogitation and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Sense arguing a more perfect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Union than is in meer indiscerpibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of parts. But all this scrupulosity might have been saved; for I confidently promise my self, that there are none so perversely given to tergiversations and subterfuges; but that they will acknowledge, where ever I can prove that there is a Substance distinct from Body or Matter, that it is in the most full and proper sense Incorporeal.</p>

               </p>
               <p>For Demonstration of this Truth, there needs nothing more than a silent appeal to a mans own mind, if he does not finde it so: and that he take away all <hi>Aptitudes, Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Properties</hi> and <hi>Modifications</hi> from a <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> that his Conception thereof vanishes into Nothing, but into the <hi>Idea</hi> of a meer undiversificated substance; so that one sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is not then distinguishable from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55271:51"/> but onely from <hi>Accidents</hi> or <hi>Modes,</hi> to which properly belongs no Substance: But for Attributes, they are as Conspicuous as the Attributes of any subject or substance, whatsoever; as I defined him in the first Chapter, <hi>viz. God is a Spirit eternal, Infinite in Essence and Goodness, Omniscient, Omnipotent, and of himself necessarily Existent.</hi> For <hi>a Spirit</hi> I have explained already, and by <hi>Eternal,</hi> I understand nothing here, but duration with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end or beginning, by <hi>Infiniteness of Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,</hi> that his Essence hath no bounds, no more than his Duration: by Infinite in Goodness, such a benign will in God, as is carried out to boundlesse and innumerable benefactions: by <hi>Omnisciency</hi> and Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, the ability of knowing or doing any thing that can be conceived without a plain contradiction; by <hi>self-Existency</hi> that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not faile to be. What terms of any Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are more plain than these of this; or what subject can be more accurately defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned than this is? For the naked subject or substance of any thing is no otherwise to be known then thus; and they that gape after any other speculative knowledge of <hi>God</hi> then what is from his Attributes and Operations, they may have their heads filled with <hi>fiery fancies,</hi> and their <hi>mouths with burning
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55271:51"/> words,</hi> and run mad with the boisterousnes of their own imagination, but they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hit upon any sober truth.</p>
               <p>Thus have I delivered a very explicite and intelligible <hi>Idea</hi> of the nature of God; which I might also more compendiously define, an Essence absolutely perfect, in which all the terms of the former Definition are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and more than I have named, or thought needfull to name, much lesse to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist upon; as his power of Creation and his Omnipresence or Ubiquity, which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily included in the <hi>Idea</hi> of absolute perfection; The latter whereof some anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Philosophers endeavouring to set out, have defined <hi>God to be a Globe of Light, a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle whose Centre is every where, and Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence no where,</hi>
                  <figure/> by which descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption certainly nothing else can be meant, but that the Divine Essence is every where present with all those A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorable Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of Infinite and absolutely perfect Goodnesse, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55271:52"/> and Power; according to the sense in which I have explained them, which Ubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity or Omnipresence of <hi>God,</hi> is just as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible as the overspreading Matter in to all places.</p>
               <p>But if there be any <hi>Novice Astrologer</hi> demand how the parts, as I may so call them, of the Divine Amplitude hold together, that of Matter being so discerpible; it might be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to remind him, of what we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready spoken of the general <hi>Idea</hi> of a Spirit: But besides that, here may be also a peculiar, rational account given thereof; it implying a contradiction, that an <hi>Essence</hi> absolutely perfect, should be either limitted in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, or change place in part or whole; they being both notorious effects or simptoms of imperfection, which is inconsistent with the Nature of <hi>God;</hi> And no better nor more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent reason can be given of any thing then that it implies a contradiction to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
               <p>That power also of Creating things of Nothing, there is a very close connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt that and the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> or of a being absolutely perfect, for this being would not be what it is conceived to be; if it were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of the power of Creation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Attribute hath no lesse coherence
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55271:52"/> with the subject, than that it is a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, it should not be in it, as was observed of the foregoing attribute of indiscerpibility in God; but to alleadge that a man cannot imagine how <hi>God</hi> should create something of nothing, or how the <hi>Divine Essence</hi> holds so closely and invincibly together, is to deny, That, <hi>all our faculties have not a right of suffrage for determining of Truth, but onely common I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea's, external sense, and evident and undeniable deductions of Reason;</hi> Hereby <hi>common Ideas or Notions</hi> I understand whatever is <hi>Nomatically</hi> true, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> true at first sight, to all <hi>Heydoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> or men in their wits, upon a clear per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Terms, without any further discourse or reasoning from <hi>external sense;</hi> I conclude not memory, as it is a faithfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister thereof, and you cannot appeal to a faculty that hath no right to determine the case: We have now sufficiently spoken of the <hi>Idea</hi> of that Infinite and <hi>uncreated spirit,</hi> we u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually call <hi>God:</hi> We will passe now on our way into another Region, to those <hi>Spirits</hi> that are <hi>Created</hi> and <hi>Finite,</hi> as the <hi>spirits</hi> of <hi>Angels, Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, Stars, Men</hi> and <hi>Brutes;</hi> we will cast in the <hi>seminal Forms</hi> also or <hi>Archei,</hi> as the <hi>Rosie Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> call them, though haply the world stands in no need of them.

               <p>I have given rational grounds, of the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discerpibility</hi> of a <hi>spirit,</hi> to evince it not impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, it being an imediate Attribute thereof, as impenetrability is of a body, and as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable or imaginable, that one substance of its own nature may invincibly hold its parts together; so that they cannot be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united nor dissevered, as that another may keep out so stoutly and irresistibly another substance from entering into the same space or place with it self; for this <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or impenetrability is not at all contained in the precise Conception of a <hi>Substance</hi> as <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:55271:53"/> as I have already signified. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that reason we may thus easily appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that it may be so; I shall a little grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie imagination, and it may be reason too, in offering the manner how it is so, in this kinde of spirit I now speak of. That ancient <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>intentional species</hi> is so from a plain impossibility, that has been heretofore generally, and is still by Mr. <hi>Tho. Heydon,</hi> Dr. <hi>Ward,</hi> and other learned men looked upon as a truth; that is, That <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Colour</hi> do ray in such sort, they are described in the <hi>Rosie Crucian Phylosophy;</hi> Now it is observable in <hi>light,</hi> that it is most vigorous towards its fountain, and fainter by degrees. But we will reduce the matter to one lucid point, which according to the acknowledged principles of Opticks, will fill a distance of space with its rayes of <hi>light;</hi> which rays may indeed be reverberated back towards their Centre, by interposing some Opake body, and so this orbe of <hi>light</hi> contracted; but according to the <hi>Rosie Crucian Hypothesis,</hi> it was alwayes accounted impossible, that they should be clipt off, or cut from this lucid point, and be kept a part by themselves; Those whom dry reason will not satisfie, shall have hard blows, or if they please, they may entertain their fancy with such a Representation as
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55271:54"/> this, which may a little ease the Anxious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of their mind, when it would too eagerly comprehend the manner how this spirit I speak of, may be said to be indiscer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pible. For think of any ray of this <hi>Globe</hi> or <hi>Orbe</hi> of <hi>Lights,</hi> it does sufficiently set out to the imagination, how extention and indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerpibility may consist together; see my Book, entitled, <hi>The Temple of Wisdome,</hi> as also, <hi>The Wisemans Crown,</hi> chap. 9.</p>
               <p>But if any Object, that the lucid point of this Orbe, or the primary substance, as I call it, in my <hi>Rosie Crucian Infallible Axiomata, cap.</hi> 3. is either divisible or absolutely indivisible, and if it be divisible, that as concerning the <hi>inmost</hi> of a <hi>spirit,</hi> this representation is not at all serviceable to set off the nature thereof; by shewing how the parts there may hold together so indiscerpibly, but if absolutely indivisible, that it seems to be nothing: To this I answer what Sr. <hi>Chr. Heydon,</hi> hath somewhere noted, <hi>That what is infinitely great or infinitely small, the imagination of a man is at a loss to conceive it.</hi> Which certainly is the ground of the perplexedness of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme concerning Matter, whether it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists of points, or onely of Particles divisible <hi>in infinitum,</hi> but to come more closely to the businesse; I say, that though we should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55271:54"/> the inmost centre of life; or the very first point, as I may so call it, of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary substance (for this primary substance is gradually to be purely indivisible, it does not at all follow, no not according to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination it self, that it must be nothing. For let us imagine a perfect Plain, a Bowling-green bigger than <hi>Salisbury Plain,</hi> and on this Plain, the <hi>Globe of Mercury,</hi> we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive but this Globe touches the Plain, and that in what we ordinarily call a point, else the one would not be Globe, or the other not a Plain; Now it is impossible, that one body should touch another, and yet touch one another in nothing; Wherefore this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Centre of life is something, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so full of essential vigour and virtue, that though gradually it diminish; yet can fill a certain <hi>sphere</hi> of space with its own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and activity, as a spark of light illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates the duskish Aire; wherefore there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no greater perplexity nor subtilty in the consideration of this Centre of life, or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most</hi> of a <hi>spirit,</hi> then there is in the <hi>Attomes</hi> of Matter, we may now rightly conclude, that indiscerpibility hath nothing in the <hi>Idea</hi> thereof, but what may well consist with the possibility of the existence of the subject whereunto it belongs.</p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:55271:55"/>
               <p>Let us advance yet higher, and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate the possibility of this <hi>Idea</hi> to the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest reason, out of these following Principles, <hi>viz.</hi> A <hi>Globe</hi> touches a Plain; admit for an Example one of Mr. <hi>Jo Moxons</hi> Globes and one of Mr. <hi>John Collins</hi> his Plains: The Globe I say touches the Plain in something, though in the least, <hi>that is conceivable to be reall; the least that is conceivable is so little, that it cannot be conceived to be discerpible into less; As little as this is, the repetition of it will amount to conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable magnitudes:</hi> If this Globe be drawn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Plain, it constitutes a <hi>line,</hi> and a <hi>Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> drawn upon a Plain, or this same line de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by the Globe multiplied into it self, constitutes a superficies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This a man cannot deny, but the more he thinks of it, the more certainly true he will finde it.</p>
               <p>Magnitudes cannot arise out of meer non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magnitudes; and if you multiply nothing ten thousand millions of times into nothing, the product will be still nothing: Besides, if that wherein the Globe touches a Plain, were more then indiscerpible, that is, purely Indivisible; it is manifest, that a <hi>line</hi> will consist of points Mathematically so called, that is, purely indivisible, which is the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest absurdity that can be admitted in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, and the most contradictious thing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55271:55"/> imaginable, the same thing by reason of its extream littlenesse may be utterly indiscer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pible, though intellectually divisible: For every quantity is intellectually divisible; but something indiscerpible was afore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated to be quantity, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly divisible; otherwise Magnitude would consist of Mathematical points: Thus have I found a possibility for <hi>Idea of the Centre of a Spirit;</hi> which is not a <hi>Mathematical point,</hi> but a substance in magnitude, so little, that it is Indiscerpible; but in vertue so great, that it can send forth out of it self, so large a sphere of <hi>secondary</hi> substance, as I may so call it, that it is able to actuate grand proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of matter; this whole sphere of life and activity being in the mean time utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discerpible.</p>
               <p>This I have said, and shall now prove it by adding a few more principles of that evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, I have written at the latter end of the first Chapter of this <hi>Book,</hi> and shall here so explain them, as the most rigorous reason shall not be able to deny; <hi>An Emanative cause is the Idea or Notion of a thing possible:</hi> Now by an Emanative cause is understood, as meerly by being, no other activity or causa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity interposed, produces an Effect; That this is possible, is manifest, it being demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strable,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55271:56"/> that there is <hi>de facto,</hi> some such cause in the world; because something must move it self; now if there be no Spirit, Matter must of necessity move it self, where you cannot imagine any Activity or Causality; but the bare Essence of the Matter from whence this motion comes: For if you would suppose some former Motion that might be the cause of this, then we might with as good reason suppose some former to be the cause of that, and so <hi>in infinitum</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An Emanative Effect is coexistent with the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry substance of that which is said to be the cause thereof.</hi> And this must needs be true, because that very substance which is said to be the cause, is the adequate and immediate cause, and wants nothing to be adjoyned to its bare Essence, for the production of the Effects: And therefore by the same reason the Effect is at any time; it must be at all times, or so long as that substance does exist. <hi>No Emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Effect, that exceeds not the vertues and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of a Cause can be said to be impossible to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There may be a substance of that high vertue and excellency, that it may produce another sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance by Emanativ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> causallity; provided that substance produced be in due graduall proportions inferiour to that which causes it:</hi> Now there is
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55271:56"/> no contradiction nor impossibility of a Cause producing an effect lesse noble than it self; for thereby we are the better assured that it does not exceed the capacity of its own Powers: Nor is this any incongruity, that one Substance should cause something else, which we may in some sense call substance; though but <hi>secondary</hi> or <hi>Emanatory;</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the <hi>Primary Substance</hi> to be the more adequate ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ect of Divine Creation; but the secondary to be referrible also to the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or <hi>Central</hi> substance, by way of causall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: For suppose <hi>God created the Matter</hi> with an immediate power of moving it self; <hi>God</hi> indeed is the prime cause as well of the Motion as of the Matter; and yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the Matter is rightly said to move it self; Finally, this <hi>secondary</hi> or <hi>Emanatory substance,</hi> because it is a subject indued with certain powers and activities, and that it does not inhaere as an accident in any other substance or matter, but could maintain its place, though all Matter or what other Substance soever were removed out of that space it is extended through, provided its <hi>primary sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> be but safe.</p>
               <p>From these four principles I have here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain added from the first Chapter, we may have not an imaginary but rational appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55271:57"/> of that part of Spirit, which we call the secondary substance thereof; whose ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension arising by gradual Emanation from the first and primest Essence (as you read before in the first Chapter,) which we call <hi>Centre</hi> of the Spirit, which is no impossible supposition; we are led from hence to a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary acknowledgment of perfect indiscer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pibility of parts, though not intellectually Indivisibility, for that would imply a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, that an Emanative effect should be disjoyned from its original.</p>
               <p>Thus have I demonstrated the graduall descent of <hi>Spirits,</hi> and how a <hi>spirit</hi> consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the linements of it (as I may so call them) from the <hi>Centre</hi> to the <hi>Circumference</hi> is utterly indiscerpible: but now if any be so curious, as to ask how the parts thereof hold together in a line drawn crosse to these from the Centre; (for imagination, it may be, will suggest they lye all loose?) I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer that the conjecture of imagination is here partly true and partly false, or is true or false, as she shall be interpreted; for if she be loose, actually disunited, it is false and rediculous: but if onely so discerpible, that one part may be disunited from another, that is not onely true but necessary; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it could not contract one part and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55271:57"/> another, which is yet an Hypothesis necessary to be admitted: Wherefore this Objection is so far from weakening the possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of this Notion, that it gives occasion more fully to declare the exact concinnity thereof; To be brief therefore, a Spirit from the Centre to the Circumference is utterly indiscerpible, but in lines crosse to this, it is closely cohaerent, but not indiscerpibly; which cohaesion may consist in an imediate union of these parts, and transverse Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration and Transcursion of a secondary substance, through this whole Sphere of life, which we call <hi>Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor need we wonder that so full an Orbe should swell out from so subtile and small a Point, as the Centre of this Spirit is supposed <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55271:58"/> cannot at all hang together: but this is not hindering matter from actual Existence of a spirit, but the most lubricous Hypothesis that we go upon here, is not altogether so intricate as those difficulties in Matter. For if that be but granted, in which I finde no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity; that a particle of matter may be so little, that it is utterly uncapable of being made lesse; it is plain that one and the same thing, though intellectually divisible, may yet be really indiscerpible And indeed it is not onely possible, but it seems necessary that this should be true: For though we should acknowledge that matter were discerpible <hi>in infinitum,</hi> yet supposing a cause of infinite distinct perception, and as infinite power, <hi>(and God is such)</hi> this cause can reduce this capacity of infinite discerpiblenesse of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into act <hi>viz.</hi> actually, and at once discerp it, or dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

We have therefore plainly demonstrated by reason, that Matter consists of parts indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerpible; and therefore there being no other
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55271:58"/> faculty to give suffrage against it; for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sense nor any common notion can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict it; it remains, <hi>Whatever is clear to any one of these three faculties, is to be held un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly true, the other having nothing to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the contrary:</hi> Or else a man shall not be assured of any sensible object that he meets with, nor can give firm assents to such truths as these; It is impossible the same thing should be, and not be, at once; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is, is either Finite or Infinite, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and thus doe I prove my Conclusion true.</p>
               <p>What some would object from Reason, that these perfect parvitudes being acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged still intellectually divisible, must still have parts into which they are divisible; and therefore be still discerpible? to this it is answered; That division into parts does not imply any discerpibility, because the parts conceived in one of these <hi>minima Corporalia,</hi> as I may so call them are rather Essential or Formal parts then integrall, and can no more actually be dissevered than sense and reason from the Soul of a man: For it is of the very essence of Matter to be divisible, but it is not at all included in the essence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to be discerpible; and therefore where discerpibility failes, there is no necessity that divisibility should fail also: As for the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55271:59"/> of spurious sugestions or representations from the fancy, as if these perfect parvitudes, were round bodies, and that therefore there would be triangular intervals betwixt, void of matter; they are of no moment in this Case, she alwayes representing a discerpible magnitude instead of an indiscerpible one; wherefore she brings in false evidence, her testimony is to be rejected: Nay, if she could perplex the cause far worse, she was not to be heard; wherefore fancy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unable to exhibite the Object we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, in its due advantages, for ought we know these perfect parvitudes may lie so close together, that they have no intervals betwixt: nay, it seems necessary to be so; for if there were any such intervals, they were capable of particles, lesse than these least of all, which is a contradiction in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and a thing utterly impossible.</p>
               <p>But if we should gratifie Fancy so far as to Admit of these intervalls, the greatest ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity would be, that we must admit an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible vacuum, which no Faculty will be able ever to confute, but it is most rationall to admit none, and more consonant to our determination concerning these <hi>minima Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralia,</hi> as the <hi>Rosie Crucians</hi> call them, whose largenesse is to be limited to the least real
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55271:59"/> touch of either a <hi>Globe</hi> or <hi>plaine,</hi> or a <hi>Cone</hi> on a <hi>plaine,</hi> or a <hi>Globe</hi> on a <hi>Globe:</hi> if you conceive any reall touch lesse then another, let that be the measure of these <hi>Minute Realities</hi> in matter, from whence it will follow, they must touch a whole side at once, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can never leave any empty intervals; Nor can we Imagine any Angulosityes or round protuberancies in a quantity infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly little, more then we can in one infinitely great, as I have already declared in my book, called, <hi>The Wise mans Crown:</hi> I must confess a mans reason in this speculation is mounted far beyond his imagination; but there being worse intricacies in <hi>Theories</hi> acknowledged constantly to be true, it can be no prejudice to the present conclusion.</p>
               <p>Thus have I not only said, there is a <hi>God, Angels</hi> or <hi>Messengers,</hi> that wait upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Ideas,</hi> but proved it also: and the <hi>Idea</hi> of a Spirit and its indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerpibility, as well in Centre as Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, as well in the primary as secondary substance thereof, to be a very consistent and Congruous Notion, but before I can come to the <hi>Harmony of the Macrocosme or great world,</hi> another property runs by me: that I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to be self Motion, which must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity be an Attribute of something or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for by self motion I understand nothing
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55271:60"/> else but self activity, which must appertain to a subject active of it self. Now what is simple Active of it self, can no more cease to be active then to Be; which is a signe that Matter is not Active of it self, because it is reducible to Rest:</p>
               <p>Which is an Argument not only that self Activity belongs to a Spirit, but that there is such a thing as a Spirit in the world, from which Activity is communicated to Matter: And indeed if Matter as Matter had Motion, nothing would hold together but <hi>Flints, Pebbles, middle Minerals, Adamants, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rasse, Iron, Silver, Gold;</hi> yea this whole earth would suddenly melt into a thiner substance then the subtile Aire, or rather it never had been condensed together to this consisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy we finde it: But this is to Anticipate my purpose of proving, that there are spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits existing in the world, that conduct the <hi>Heavens, Stars, Planets, Men, Beasts</hi> and all manner of living Creatures in their <hi>motions, Beings</hi> and <hi>Actions,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It had been sufficient here to have asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, That self Motion, or self Activity is as Conceivable to appertain to a spirit as body, which is plain at first sight to any man that appeals to his own faculties. Nor is it all to be scrupled at, that any thing should be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55271:60"/> to move it self; because our Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that say, there is nothing but Matter in the world, must of necessity (as I have inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated already) confesse that this Matter moves it self, though it be very incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous so to affirm; The congruity and possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of self penetration in a created spirit is to be conceived, partly from the limitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the subject, and partly from the foregoing Attributes of indiscerpibility and self motion; for self penetration cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to <hi>God,</hi> because it is impossible any thing should belong to him that implies im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, and self penetration cannot be without the lessening of the presence of that which does penetrate it self, or the implica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that some parts of that essence are not so well as they may be, which is a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in a Being, which is absolutely perfect. From the Attributes of indiscerpibility and self motion, to which you may add penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility from the general <hi>Idea</hi> of a spirit, it is plain that such a spirit as we define, having the power of Motion upon the whole extent of its essence, may also determine this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, according to the property of its own nature: And therefore if it determine the motion of the exteriour parts inward, they would return inwards the Centre of essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55271:61"/> power; which they may easily doe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out resistance, the whole subject being pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable, and without damage, it being also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discerpible;</p>
               <p>From this self penetration we do not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly easily, but necessarily understand self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction and dilatation to arise; for this self moving substance, which we call a spirit cannot penetrate it self; but it must needs therewith contract it self; nor restore it self again to its former state; but it does there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by dilate it self; so that we need not at all insist upon these terms: That power which a spirit hath to penetrate Matter we may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily understand, if we consider a spirit onely as a substance, whose immediate property is Activity. For then it is not harder to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine this active substance to pervade this or the other part of matter, then it is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the pervading or dispreading of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it self therein.</p>
               <p>The greatest difficulty is to fancy how this spirit, being so incorporeal can be able to move the matter, though it be in it, for it seems so subtle, that it will passe through, leaving no more footsteps of its being there, then the lightning does in the scabbard, though it may happily melt the sword, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it there finds resistance. But a spirit can
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55271:61"/> find no resistance any where, the closest mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being easily penetrable &amp; pervious to an incorporeal substance, the ground of this difficulty is founded upon the unreceivable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of any <hi>Ʋnion</hi> that can be betwixt the matter and a substance, that can so easily passe through it. For if we could but once imagine union betwixt Matter and a Spirit, the activity then of the Spirit would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have influence upon Matter, either for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting or increasing, or directing the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof. But notwithstanding the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrability and easie passage of a Spirit through Matter, there is yet for all that a strong union betwixt them, and every whit as conceivable as betwixt the parts of Matter themselves, for what Glue or Cement holds the parts of hard matter in Stones and Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals together, or, if you will, of what is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely hard, that has no pores or particles, but is one continued and perfectly homoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous body, not onely to sense, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the exact <hi>Idea</hi> of Reason, what Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments holds together the parts of such a body as this? Certainly nothing but <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Ʋnion and Rest:</hi> Now for Union there is no comparison betwixt that of matter with matter, and this of spirit with matter. For the first is onely superficiall; in this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55271:62"/> the very inward parts are united point to point throughout; nor is there any fear it will not take hold, because it has a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of passing through: For if we admit an absolutely hard, solid body in the <hi>World,</hi> which let be<figure/> A. in which let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive inward Superficies, suppose E. A. C. this Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies, is so smooth as nothing can be conceived smoother; why does not therefore the upper E. D. C. slide upon the neather part E.F.C. upon the least motion imaginable, especially E. F.C. being supposed to be held fast, whilest the other is thrust against?</p>
               <p>This facility therefore of one body passing upon another without any sticking, seeming as necessary to our fancy as a spirit passing through all bodies, without taking hold of them; it is plain that a firm union of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and matter is very possible, though we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> conceive the manner thereof. And
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55271:62"/> as for Rest, it is compitable also to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of Matter with Spirit, as well as of Matter with matter. For suppose the whole body A. moved with like swiftnesse in every part, the parts of A. then are according to that sense of rest, by which they would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the Adhaesian of the parts of Matter one with another, truly quiescent.</p>
               <p>So say I that in the union of matter with the spirit, the parts of the matter receiving from the spirit, just such a velocity of motion as the spirits exerts and no more; they both rest in firm union one with another. That which comes to passe even then, when there is far lesse immediate Union then we speak of; For if we do but lay a piece of Gold on our hand, provided our hand be not moved with a swifter motion then it communicates to the <hi>gold,</hi> nor the <hi>gold</hi> be pusht on faster then the swiftnesse of our hand: The <hi>gold</hi> and hand will most certainly retain their union and go together: So natural and easie it is to conceive, how a <hi>spirit</hi> may move a <hi>body</hi> without any more perplexity, or contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction then is found in the union and motion of the parts of matter it self.</p>

               <p>NOw being come to behold the <hi>Harmony</hi> of the world; I say all musick consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in voice, in sound, and hearing: sound without aire cannot be audible, nor to be perceived by any sense, unlesse by accident; for the fight seeth it not, unlesse it be colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, nor the ears unlesse sounding, nor the smell unlesse odoriferous, nor the taste un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it be sapid, nor the touch unlesse it be cold or hot, and so forth. Therefore though sound cannot be made without Aire, yet is not sound of the nature of aire, nor aire of the nature of sound; but aire is the body of the life of our sensitive spirit, and is not of the nature of any sensible object, but of a
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55271:63"/> more simple and higher vertue; but it is meet that the sensitive Soul should vivifie the aire joyned to it, and in the vivificated aire, which is joyned to the spirit, perceive the species of objects put forth into act, and this is done in the living aire, but in a subtile and Diaphanous, the visible species, in an ordinary aire the audable, in a more grosse aire the species of other senses are perceived.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Planets, Saturn, Mars,</hi> and the <hi>Moon</hi> have more of the voice then of the <hi>Harmony.

               <p>But by the violent motion of the <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi> is the most swift and accute sound of all; but the violent Motion of the <hi>Moon</hi> is most slow and heavy, which proportion and reciprocation of motions, yeilds a most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Harmony; from hence there are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Songs, Sounds, or Musicall Instruments, more powerfull in moving mans affections, or introducing impressions, then those which are composed of Numbers, Measures, and Proportions, after the example of the <hi>Heavens;</hi> Also the <hi>Harmony</hi> of the <hi>Elements</hi> is drawn forth from their basis and <hi>Angles,</hi> as I shall speak of in order: now between <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Aire,</hi> there is a double proportion in the

                  <hi>Basis,</hi> and one and a half in solid Angles, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in planets a double; there arising hence an Harmony of a double Diapason, and Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pente; betwixt the <hi>Aire</hi> and <hi>Water,</hi> the proportion in their basis is double, and one and a half; hence Diapason and Diapente, but in their Angles double: hence again Diapason.</p>

               <p>FIrst, I consider the transcendent Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Nature of God; who being according to the true <hi>Idea</hi> of him, an essence absolutely perfect, cannot possibly be Body, and consequently must be something incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal; and seeing that there is no contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in the <hi>Idea</hi> of a spirit in general, nor in any of those kinde of spirits which I have written of; (where the <hi>Idea</hi> of God were set down amongst the rest) and that in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Idea</hi> of him, there is contayned the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his existence, as you may see at large in my <hi>Temple of Wisdome,</hi> about the eighth Chapter; certainly if we finde any thing at all to be, we may safely conclude that he is much more For there is nothing besides him, of which one can give a reason why it is, unlesse we suppose him to be the Author of it.</p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:55271:67"/>
               <p>Wherefore though God be neither visible nor Tangible, yet his very <hi>Idea</hi> represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to our Intellectuall faculties the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary reason of his existence, we are (though we had no other argument drawn from our senses) confidently to conclude, that he is the first mover and cause of all things, in this Harmonious world.</p>
               <p>The second Ground is the ordinary <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi> of nature, the most generall whereof is Motion. Now it seems to me demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from hence, that there is some being in the world distinct from matter. For mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being of one simple homogenial nature, &amp; not distinguishable by specificall differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as the schools, it must have ever the very same Essentiall properties, and therefore of it self it must all of it be either without motion, or else be self moving, and that in such or such a tenor or measure of motion, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no reason immaginable, why one part of the matter should move of it self, less then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; and therefore if there be any such thing, it can only arise from external impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment; now I say, if matter be utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd of Motion in it self, it is plain it has its motion from some other substance that is not matter, that is to say, a <hi>Substance</hi> Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal. But if it be moved of it self, in such
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55271:68"/> or such a measure, the effect here being an Emanative Effect, cannot possible faile to be wherever Matter is; especially, if there be no external impedement: And there is no impediment at all, but that the Terrestrial parts might regaine an Activity very nigh equall to the Aetheriall, or rather never have lost it.</p>
               <p>For if the <hi>Planets</hi> had but a Dividend of all the motion which themselves and the Sun and Stars, and all the <hi>Aetherial</hi> matter possess (the matter of the <hi>Planets,</hi> being so little in comparison of that of the <hi>Sun, Stars</hi> and <hi>Aether</hi>) the proportion of motion that wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> fall due to them, would be exceeding much above what they have▪ for it would be as if four or five poor men in a very rich and popular City should, by giving up that estate they have, in a Levelling way, get equall share with all the rest; wherefore every <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> could not faile of melting it self into lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle lesser, finer substance then the purest <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> but they not doing so, it is a signe, they have not their Motion, Harmony, and Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, nor influence of themselves; and therefore rest content with what has extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sically accrued to them, be it less or more.</p>
               <p>But the Pugnacious, to evade the stroke of our <hi>Dilemma,</hi> will make any bold shift, and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55271:68"/> though they affront their own faculties in saying so, yet they will say and must say, that the <hi>Planets, Heavens, Angels</hi> and <hi>Men</hi> are without motion of themselves, although they will say in spite of me, that part of the matter is self moving.</p>
               <p>But to this I Answer, that first, this Evasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theirs is not so agreeable to experience, but so farr as either our sence or reason can reach, there is the same matter every where: For consider the subtle parts of matter dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable here below, those which for their subtlety are invisible, and for their activity wonderfull; I mean those particles that cause that vehement agitation we feel in <hi>Winds.</hi> They in time loose their motion, and become of a <hi>visible</hi> vapours consistencie, and turn to <hi>Clouds</hi> then to <hi>Snow</hi> or <hi>Rain,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter haply to <hi>Ice</hi> it self; but then in processe of time, first melted into Water, then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haled into Vapours; after more firmly agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, do become <hi>Winde</hi> again: And that we may not think that this reciprocation into motion and rest belongs only to <hi>Terrestriall particles;</hi> that the <hi>Heavens</hi> themselves be of the same matter, is apparent from the <hi>Ejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of <hi>Comets</hi> into one <hi>Vortex, (as you may read in the Methodically Learned Mathematician Mr.</hi> John Gadbury <hi>his Book of</hi> Prodigies,) and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55271:69"/> the perpetuall rising of those Spots and Scum upon the face of the <hi>Sun.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But secondly, To returne what is still more pugnant: This matter that is self moved, in the impressing of motion upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter, either loose of its own motion, or reteyns it still intire, if the first, it may be dispoyled of all its motion: and so that whose immediate nature is to <hi>Move</hi> shall <hi>Rest,</hi> the entire cause of its motion still remaining <hi>viz</hi> it self: which is a plain contradiction, if the second, no meaner an inconvenience then this will follow, that the whole world had been turned in to pure <hi>Aether</hi> by this time, if not into a perfect flame, or at least will be in the conclusion, to the utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of all Corporeall Consistencies, for, that these self moving parts of matter are of a Considerable copiousnesse, the events does testify, they having melted almost all the world already into <hi>Suns, Starrs</hi> and <hi>Aether,</hi> nothing remaining but <hi>Planets</hi> and <hi>Comets</hi> to be dissolved: which all put together scarce beare so great a proportion as a Cherry to the Ball of the Earth, wherefore so potent a principle of Motion, still adding new motion to matter, and no motion once communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, being lost (for according to the Lawes of motion, no body looses any more motion
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55271:69"/> then it communicates to any other) it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follows, that either the world had been utterly burnt up ere now, or will be at the end of every seven thousand years, which is a lesse time to come than that which is past: let us passe to the Harmony of the Aspects of Starrs.</p>

               <p>I Grant that in all Scituations the <hi>Starrs</hi> send forth their beams unto all the parts of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> which they behold, as may be argued out of Sr. <hi>Christopher Heydon,</hi> in defence for <hi>Astrology</hi> and discourses by means whereof, the beams and lines of true motion in every two <hi>Stars</hi> do retaine a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall respect one to another, and so do ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more intercept some Arke of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:55271:70"/> concur at some Angle of the Earth, which may seem to make an Aspect among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: yet neverthelesse all the Antient and Moderne <hi>Astronomers</hi> following nature for their guide, have heretofore regarded these few configurations only, being but five in all, namely, the <hi>Conjunction, Sextile, Quartile,</hi> and <hi>Opposition;</hi> amongst which although the first do not commonly go for an Aspect, because every Aspect is reputed a proportioned di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance between two or more Starrs; yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse seeing a certain position of the <hi>Starrs</hi> in the <hi>Zodiack</hi> is rather considered in this position, then any diversity of place, and that the enumeration of the Aspects e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver beginneth from the Conjunction: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as well in respect of this Analogy, as of the received use, it may not be secluded out of the number of Aspects, especially know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Beames of the Starrs are as well extended upward and downward as obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quely &amp; Collatterally; &amp; by these beams are those <hi>Idea's,</hi> which originally proceed from God gradually imparted to the Aire, and from the air to the matter daily, by the help of the soul of the world, for the <hi>Anima Mundi</hi> hath in the fixed Stars her particular forms or Seminal Conceptions answerable to the <hi>Ideas</hi> of the Divine minde; of this you
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:55271:70"/> shall be better satisfyed in the following discourse.</p>
               <p>Now if any man desire to know my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, why I observe these distances and Arks assigned unto the Aspects, as of more vertue then any other, surely the answer is easy, seeing nature it self every where, both in the motions and effects of the heavenly bodies, as also in other Arithmeticall, and Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricall respects, chiefly celebrateth these ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proportions with a Singular prerogative, Nature hath as it were first allured us to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Aspects by speciall tokens or secret marks in the motion, and by them we know the Nature of the Native, in Body &amp; Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Agrippa</hi> speaking hereof, thinketh they were first induced hereunto by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the severall illuminations or ages of the <hi>Moon,</hi> for that when she is new, horned in her quarters, gibbosity and fullnesse, her formes are still changed at these proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed spaces from the Sun.</p>
               <p>Besides which, it is not to be passed in si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, which others have more particularly noted, then in her Annuall Revolution, she is still found about the <hi>Trine</hi> of her own place in the beginning of the former year.</p>
               <p>Neither have other <hi>Philosophers</hi> failed to note, how Nature pointeth (as it were with a
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:55271:71"/> finger) particularly unto every configurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that we might observe how the <hi>Angels As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend</hi> &amp; <hi>Descend,</hi> &amp; consider the motions of the other Planets. For thus <hi>Avenroes</hi> wittily affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the two inferiour <hi>Planets</hi> in their stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to observe the Arke proper to a square Aspect. <hi>Ptolomy</hi> likewise with him as skillfully commendeth unto us the observation of the △ by the stations of the three superiour <hi>pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets.</hi> But above all, it cannot be considered without deep admiration, how nature hath singularly nobilitated all the Aspects in the motions of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter;</hi> for as their Conjunctions are rare, and but once in twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years; so hath nature evermore disposed these Conjunctions in the most memorable places of the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> that is onely in such <hi>signes</hi> as behold one another in an <hi>equaliter, Triangle</hi> inscribed; for between any two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> there are 19 <hi>Aegyptian</hi> years, 318. dayes and 13. houres, in which time those Planets are moved from the place of their Conjunction and Signes, and almost three degrees, which accesse of three degrees is the cause why after Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, they passe from one Triplicity to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and one Triplicity continueth 198. equal years 265. dayes (the intercalary day of every four year omitted) and ten
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55271:71"/> houres. But the Revolution of all the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicities is finished, but onely once in 794. equall years, 339. dayes, and 16. houres, or else in 724. <hi>Julian</hi> years, 133. dayes, 16. houres; the double commeth to 1588, which number of years they are thought to have respected, that imagined the year 1588. from the birth of <hi>our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,</hi> would have been so fatall. From hence therefore it is, that not without cause, they are called great Conjunctions; as you will finde by the great changes and cruell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of them about the years 1663, 1664, 1665, 1666, 1667, 1668, 1669. these years are likely to be troublesome; but all lyeth in the power of Almighty God; I may not tell you what shall particularly happen in the world, to <hi>France</hi> first, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They abide thus in one Triplicity almost 200. years, and not finishing all the Tripli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities of the Zodiack in much lesser than 800. years; not having therefore reiterated all the Triplicities eight times since the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world. Neither are the other Positions of the <hi>planets</hi> to be neglected; for if any man will take the pains to observe when <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> do behold one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a Square or Opposition Aspect, they shall evidently perceive that they still
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:55271:72"/> carry such a regard unto the Signs or places of their precedent Conjunctions, as ever more they irrediate the one and the other with a Sextile, Quartile, Trine or Opposition As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects: And now this shall suffice to shew how every thing receives the virtue, influence and nature of the Stars and Planets; and thus you see the reason why one hearb bears a white flower and another a red, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The corruption of the Ayre and Earth changes the colours and kindes of Plants, and their seminal forms; and these influences of the Stars send down several souls of Brutes, into various bodies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now in a word, to confirm the same by their virtue and effects: First, The <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians</hi> are taught by experience, that the Crisis of all sharpe diseases have a notorious and most memorable simpathy with all these five configurations of the <hi>Moon,</hi> to the place of her being in the beginning of the sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: Thus also you see the Seas themselves in their Tides to dance as it were after the motion of the <hi>Moon,</hi> while their Spring and highest floods alwayes comes with her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction and Opposition to the Sun, as their Neaps and lowest Tides doe likewise respect her Quarters; and as memorable a thing it is, that the Seas in their daily flowing and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55271:72"/> ebbing upon every Coast, have still a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant respect onely to such <hi>Azimuthal</hi> circles as are in a <hi>Quartile</hi> positure when the Moon passeth by them, it is more manifest then that I need to insist upon it, that the Sun it self seemeth greatly to respect the <hi>Quartile,</hi> in that he moderateth the vicissitudes of foure quarters of the year by his ingresse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the four Aequinoctial and Tropical points.</p>
               <p>But now to descend to other speculations more misticall then these, it is not amisse to begin with the Arithmeticall Observation, which the <hi>Rosie Crucians</hi> make of the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Signes agreeable to the Aspects; 1, 2. 3, 4. 6. answering in order to the <hi>Conjunction, Sextile, Quartile, Trine,</hi> and <hi>Opposition,</hi> for these numbers only, and none other, will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> consisting of twelve signes, for which reason, they make them the only aliquate parts of a Circle. Thus also the Famous <hi>Ptolomy</hi> addeth not a little to the di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gnity of these irradiations, when he first ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served the <hi>Geometrical</hi> proportion, which the subtenses of every of these Arks do retain in power to the Diameter of a Circle, as every man may read in the <hi>Quadripartite,</hi> others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, with no lesse subtlety, have observed, that amongst all Regular or ordinate figures that may be inscribed in a Circle, though
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:55271:73"/> the same be infinite, there are none whose sides and Angles carry away the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive both at the Circumference and Center, but those whose sides and Angles are answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the subtenses and Arkes of their As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects:</p>
               <p>For thus amongst all ordinate Plains that may be inscribed, there are two whose sides joyned together have preheminence to take up a Semi-Circle, but only the <hi>Hexagon, Quadrate,</hi> and <hi>Aequilaterall Triangle,</hi> answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Sextile, Quartile,</hi> and <hi>Trine,</hi> irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diated the subtence thereof, of a <hi>Sextile</hi> As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, consisteth of two signes, joyned to the subtence of a <hi>Trine,</hi> composed of foure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing regular and aequilater, take up six signes which is a compleat semicircle; in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the sides of a quadrate inscribed, subten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding three signs, twice reckoned, do employ likewise the Mediety of a Circle, and what those Figures are beforesaid to performe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doubled or joyned together, may also be truly ascribed unto the opposite aspect by it self, for that the Diametrall Line, which passeth from the place of Conjunction to the opposite point, divideth a <hi>Circle into two equal parts, the like whereof cannot be found in any other inscripts.</hi> For example, the side of a Ruler
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55271:73"/>
                  <hi>Pentagon</hi> subtended 72, degr. of an Octagon, but 45. the remainder of which Arks, <hi>viz.</hi> 108 and 135. gr. are not subtended by the sides of any ordinate figure.</p>
               <p>We will in order shew you the <hi>Harmony</hi> of <hi>Beams,</hi> and how the <hi>Seminall formes, Soules</hi> of <hi>Brutes, Humane Soules,</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> glides down by them; Now the subtenses of these Aspects be the same with the sides of the fore-remembred inscripts, and do one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therefore take up the circumference of a Circle: So it is evident, that the angles at which they concur, be the same wherewith the ordinate plains take up the whole space about the Centre; for if we consider the angle of a Sextile at the Earth, it is all one with that of an equilater triangle, consisting of 60. gr. and containeth ⅔ of a right angle, but six times ⅔ of a right angle makes four right angles; where six Sextiles equal to six equilater Triangles fill the whol space about a Point, which is equall to four right angles.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Every angle of a Quartile is a right angle, and all one with the angle of rectangle Quadrilator figure; wherefore foure of them fill a whole space, and this is the reason that every Man, Woman, Monkey, Ape, Mare-man, Mare-maid, and all other living Creatures differ one from another;
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:55271:74"/> You seldome see two things of any kinde in the world a like one another, that you could not know them if they stood before you; Observe how that there is nothing upon the land, but it is also in the waters, of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of living Creatures, the reason proceeds from the Radiation of Stars, <hi>&amp;c</hi> but to my purpose.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The angle which two Stars in a Trine make at the Centre of the world, is measured by an angle of 120. gr. and so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to the angle of a regular <hi>Hexagon,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of a right angle, and of ⅓ of a right angle; and therefore taken three times maketh four right angles: Wherefore three equilater <hi>Hexagons,</hi> or three Trine Aspects, doe also fill the whole space about the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre: To which we may not improperly add the Opposite Aspect, consisting of two right angles, and therefore doubled, shall perform the like Office with the rest.</p>
               <p>Any other figure of many angles, however joyned together at the angles, shall either want of four Angles or exceed them; for example, the angle of <hi>Pentagon</hi> containeth a right angle and ⅓ more; wherefore three such angles placed about a point, shall fall short of four right angles by ⅖ of a right angle, as on the other side; four such angles
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55271:74"/> shall exceed four right Angles ⅘.</p>
               <p>These speculations therefore considered, it were senselesse to imagine, that Natu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e hath so many wayes honoured these irradia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Stars in vain, and admonished us to a special regard of them by so many rare and secret Observations both in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Planets (as you heard before) and also in their effects and proportions; if they were not indued with more virtue than others; wherefore it hath no lesse exercised the learned Dr. <hi>Ward,</hi> Mr. <hi>Tho. Heydon,</hi> Mr. <hi>More,</hi> and <hi>Eugenius Theodidactus,</hi> to finde out the reason, why these few Configurations, selected out of an infinite number, should be indued with such eminent efficacy. Neither as yet hath any reason been invented, with more applause for the probability thereof, then these proportions; <hi>The learned Knight,</hi> Sr. <hi>Christopher Heydon,</hi> demonstrates whereof, the Aspects are before shewed to consist, and they are the same which are found in <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monical Concords.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For which cause, it is also thought no lesse probable, that the light of the Stars in these proportioned distances, should powerfully affect the matter of sublunary things, then that the like Geometrical Symmetry in sounds and voices should passionately stir up
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:55271:75"/> the sense of the hearer. For to confesse the truth, so hath the admired providence of Nature ordained throughout all her works, that where due proportion is not wanting, there she never faileth to endue all her effects with such height of perfection, that the same becomes evident to the eye of every man: And from hence it is even in Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial compositions also, as in Medicines; we know those onely to be most kinde and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign which observe a competent symme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try or temperature of the Active and passive qualities; with good likelihood therefore, and appearance of truth do most of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with <hi>Hobs,</hi> Dr. <hi>Barlow</hi> of <hi>Queens,</hi> Master <hi>More,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Fisk,</hi> resolve the onely cause of this efficacy from <hi>Harmonicall proportion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And more clearly to expresse this simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude or affinity between the proportions of Aspects, and the like distances observed in the Musical Concords; we must understand (besides what we have said before) that all <hi>harmony</hi> whatsoever springeth originally from three such terms of numbers, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect each other in such sort, that still their differences retain the same proportion that is found between the extreams. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, in these three numbers 6, 4, 3. (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to the signes of the ☍, △, &amp; □ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figurations)
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:55271:75"/> here it is evident, if we compare the extreams with the mean, that two shall be the difference betwixt six<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; the first and four the second, and three the third num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
               <p>But two is double in proportion to one, therefore six the first number respecteth three, the third number with the like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion▪ The Analogie of which proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as is before remembred, is found to be the fountain of all musick (as you heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) rising originally from these three simple concording distances, which by the Musitians are called (as I have writen before) namely, Diapente, consisting of a sesquialter proportion, as six to four; or which is all one of three to two Diatessaron of a <hi>sesqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertia,</hi> as foure to three; And lastly, Diapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son consisted of a double proportion, as six to three, or two to one; and is as much in value, as both the two first distances and proportions put together.</p>

                  <hi>sesquialter</hi> and <hi>sesquitertia,</hi> according to the usuall manner of supputating proportions, we are brought to the two other compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or imperfect concords, so constituting the five first and natural distances in Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical mixture, which afterwards, as they be diversly mixed between themselves, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce infinite variety of all kinde of melody.</p>
               <p>After the same manner fareth it with the light and influence of Heaven: For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though anciently there be but five irradia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions observed, as most apt to action, namely, the ☌, ☍, △, □, &amp; ✶; yet neverthelesse there is nothing more sure, then that by the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monical mixture of these proportioned beams, the generation and corruption of all living things in the Aire, Earth, and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>viz.</hi> Men, Beasts, Fowle, Fishes, and cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping things and Plants of this mortal world, are infinitely varied; For Children cry as soon as they are born, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And you see in several forms and species according to their kindes great differences; wherefore as the force of all Harmony, so likewise the effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al reason of all action in the influence of the stars, is properly deduced from the foresaid semmetry of these distances; And therefore more fully to illustrate, that the angles of the Aspects, compared between themselves,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:55271:76"/> concur with these Harmonies of Musick, it will be no hard matter, if that which hath been often repeated before be called to minde.</p>
               <p>As that first, the Stars in an Opposite or Diametral Aspect are disjoyned by the space of two right angles, which are measured with the Ark of six signes, or 180. degrees of circumference; and that the Trine consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of four signes, or 120. degrees is in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue one right angle and 1/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of a right angle: also that the Quartile taketh up one intire right angle, and is subtended with the Ark of three signes, or 90. degrees. And lastly, that the Sextile is constituted but of two signes, or 60. gr. which is ⅔ of a right angle; which being thus, if we now so compare the two right angles of the Opposition taken to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the angles of the rest of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects; if either the Trine be placed between the Opposition and the Quartile, or the Quartile between the Opposition and the Sextile; you shall finde either way three numbers, which admit all the laws of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monical proportions; Sr. <hi>Christopher Heydon</hi> hath so well demonstrated this, that I need not further explain my minde; <hi>For his Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis salves this Phaenomena,</hi> where to let the rest passe, as plain enough of it self, by that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:55271:77"/> which is written before: You are further to note, that the Opposition compared with the Sextile, hath a triple proportion to the same, compounded of a double and sesqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alter proportion, as Diapente with Diapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in Musick is, and so is found no simple or perfect Aspect: but exactly answerable to B. flat; the first imperfect or compounded concord in Musick being a sixth from G. sol, re, <hi>ut,</hi> which neverthelesse in some respects is after a sort esteemed perfect; because it u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the same division compared to D. sol, re, that the perfect concords do; For it is half a fifth, and scituate in the middle between Γ <hi>ut</hi> and <hi>D.</hi> sol, re, as also the Sextile com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the Trine is a just half thereof, which before hath been shewed in a sesquila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proportion to the Opposition, as <hi>D.</hi> sol. re is to Γ ut, and therefore exactly agreeable to a Diapente in Musick, which the rather I here note, because you will have some use thereof afterward in observing, how spirits or Genii slip down by other beams, not formerly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, and these our best Astronomers and Mr. <hi>John Gadbury,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wing,</hi> marke new As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects. And thus much shall shortly serve for the <hi>Theory</hi> or <hi>Philosophicall</hi> speculation of them that ascribe to the efficacy of these ira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diations to the <hi>Harmonicall proportion,</hi> which
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:55271:77"/> is found between them: Wherefore <hi>seeing these Learned Gentlemen admit them into Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi> they shall then carry the same mutual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect one towards another, which the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said <hi>Harmonicall concords</hi> do retaine between themselves, what wonder is it if nature in her operations, as well by <hi>Lights</hi> as by sounds admitted no other Symmetry, but that which is derived from these proportions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting all other as irrationall and discor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
               <p>I shall next lay down some Reasons, why the aforesaid <hi>Harmonicall</hi> proportions are so effectuall, drawn from the Symmetry of the world, being the same that is found between the five regular bodies inscribed one within another, why in the infinite variety of sounds and lights, these only should consent most sweetly in musick, sending down souls so me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to the <hi>Moon,</hi> and from thence they come down sadly to the belly and Matrix of the <hi>Earth</hi> in prolific spirited <hi>Winds</hi> and <hi>Waters,</hi> and be effectual in the operations of nature: Neither hath any man herein endeavoured with more probability to give satisfaction unto the learned then <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving wittily laboured to demonstrate, that God in the creation of the world hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served the same proportion in the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:55271:78"/> and distance of the <hi>heavenly spheres,</hi> which is found in the regular <hi>Solides,</hi> which (as <hi>Geometry</hi> teacheth) have their originall from the ordinate plains: In the end con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth with good propability, that the <hi>Heavenly</hi> motions shall then consent sweetly, and Co-operate strongly together, when the nature of these sublunary things, indued (as he supposeth) with a sensitive or knowing faculty, apprehendeth the beams of the <hi>Stars</hi> to observe that respect in their concurrence at the Center of the <hi>Earth,</hi> which answereth unto the ordinate Plains, from whence the Regularity of these proportions is derived, as the impressed Characters of that <hi>Symmetry,</hi> which God is said to have used in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world it self.</p>
               <p>So supposing, that as often as the nature of anything meeteth with these proportions, it exerciseth it self as it were by <hi>The Idea,</hi> which it alwayes retayneth, and that in such sort, as what it doth but ordinarily and slackly at other times, it performeth now much more effectually, and as it were with extraordinary diligence: Nor (saith) Sr. <hi>Christopher Heydon</hi>) that these proportions work any thing of their own vertue, but of their <hi>Idea's;</hi> for in musick it is neither the sounds, neither the proportion of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:55271:78"/> that work any thing of themselves, or beget any delightfull humour in a man, but the <hi>Genius</hi> approaching to the Instruments of sense first, carrieth the sounds inwardly and entertayning it, there valueth their proportions: and (finding the same good and <hi>Geometricall</hi>) lastly exhilirateth it self, and moveth the body, wherein it is as with an Object, wherein it taketh delight.</p>
               <p>I will as perspicuously as I can deliver that which my self have further considered, as the reason why these beams should be more effectual than others, to let down and shed some secret influx of spirit; And you must know, that there is no difference between the <hi>Stars</hi> and their <hi>Orbes,</hi> but that the <hi>Star</hi> is <hi>Densior pars ejusdem,</hi> and as the <hi>Stars</hi> differ one from another in motion, magnitude, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and vertue, so likewise those parts of <hi>Heaven,</hi> not onely admit, but send down the like variety of nature and qualities; The Conjunction and Opposition are the most potent and powerfull Configurations of all others, in their union of Beams, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in this figure; where you see the Beams as well incident as reflected to be united, according to Sr. <hi>Chr. Heydons</hi> Hypothesis, let <hi>A.</hi> be in Conjunction here with <hi>B.</hi> it is first manifest, that all the Beams flowing from

                  <hi>G.</hi> and <hi>E.</hi> the points of touch in the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of <hi>A</hi> shall unite themselves with the Beams that are sent from <hi>B.</hi> to <hi>C;</hi> the Centre of the world: Secondly, you are also to observe, that in this case onely, the Beams onely of <hi>A.

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:55271:79"/> into it self, as being onely perpendicular: Whereas those Beams which are sent from the points <hi>E.</hi> and <hi>G.</hi> make an acute angle at <hi>C.</hi> and do therefore reflect the one into the other at equal angl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

C.</hi> from <hi>C.</hi> to <hi>G.</hi> Last of all, the <hi>harmony</hi> that hapneth in Opposition, is manifest without more circumstance, where the Beams sent from the opposite points make but one streight line, as <hi>G. F.</hi> and <hi>E.</hi> H. in this Figure; except in cases where the Earth is bigger than the <hi>Star</hi> in Opposition, for there without latitude, the union of their beams must needs be hindred by interposition of the Earth; for which cause it is especially here to be remembred in the Conjunction of the two inferiour Planets with the <hi>Sun:</hi> That if this happen in the <hi>Apogaeon</hi> of their <hi>Epicycles,</hi> their Conjunction shall not be of that efficacy or force, as when they are in <hi>Perigaeo;</hi> because accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of L. <hi>Verulam,</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above the <hi>sun,</hi> and the <hi>sun</hi> much bigger then they; the <hi>sun</hi> shall return all their beams to themselves from the Earth; so that their union by this means shall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted and frustrate.</p>
               <p>In like manner, in my Contemplation for help in the Configuration of the Sextile and

                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:55271:81"/> Wherefore recounting with my self some of those speculations before remembred, and specially that Theorem of <hi>Archimedes,</hi> which prove the angles of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">

               <p>For that these Irradiations onely are eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way proportionable is before proved, whether you respect the taking up of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, the power and proportion of their subtenses unto the Diameter; or lastly, and principally, the occupying of place at the Centre of the world; which preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives seeing no other Arks, Subtenses or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles do enjoy: Therefore I conclude these above all others to be proportional unto the whole Systeme of the world; for that is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said proportionable, which is neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective interrupted, nor redoundant; but such are the Arkes, Subtenses and Angles of those Irradiations, and none other: <hi>Ergo,</hi> These and none other are proportionable.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:55271:81"/> Now as that which is defective, and wanteth proportion, leaveth the Action frustrate, and without Effect.</p>
               <p>So that which on the other side offendeth in excesse, must incur the contrary fault, and over charge that which either Nature or Art intendeth; whereby of necessity it will follow, that there being no defect, nor excesse, but an equal and just mixture of the influence of the <hi>Stars</hi> in these irradiations; these onely shall be apt and convenient to produce agreeable effect in the matter of all <hi>sublunary</hi> things. For it fareth in these <hi>Effects,</hi> which are produced by the mixture of <hi>Ethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Fire, Idea's</hi> and <hi>Anima Mundi:</hi> when their light and influence comes into the <hi>aire,</hi> as with the <hi>Chymicall Doctors</hi> in their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, where the defect of heat produceth nothing: as on the other side, excesse doth either by sublimation, eruption, vitrification, breaking the vessel and the like, destroy the work.</p>
               <p>And to make it yet clearer, how the beams of any <hi>Starr</hi> do proportionally take up the centre of the world, whereas, in that which went before, I have only shewed, how the points of those ordinate plaines, whereunto these configurations have been compared, often reiterated, do take up place; I will set
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:55271:82"/> forth next, how the beams of any two Stars in any of the former configurations shall take up more space, then that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended between their incidents or beams of true motion; and how by their beams, either incident reflected, or opposite, they do possesse, and take up the whole cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of the world<figure/>

               <p>And so for the Quartile, whose beams in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident and opposite, traverse the centre of the world at foure right angles viz. A F. G. G. F. I. A. F. H. and H. F. I. seeing foure points of a rectangle quadrilater figure hath been before proved to imploy place; I like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise need no other proof then the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men will in the last figure; consider how these foure right angles move by one quartile and take up the centre of the world. But concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Trine or Sextile, although the like be evident enough to any of mean skill, yet neverthelesse there are some other specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which require a word or two more, for in the last figure suppose two starrs A. and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:55271:83"/> B. Irradiate the earth with their Sextile beams, by various <hi>Spirits</hi> or <hi>Genii</hi> according to the place of Heaven; from whence these Aspects are darted, for you shall know the <hi>Genii</hi> may vary oftener then the wind and weather, and although it be true, that by the protracting of the opposite Beam from F. to D, the centre of the whole world seemeth used with proportionable angles B. F. A. being subtended by the ark of 60. which is before declared to be the angle of an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate aequilater triangle, and so leaveth the outward angle B. F. I. equall to the Angle of an ordinate <hi>Hexagon,</hi> subtended hereby the ark, 120, which is the ark of a Trine; the like being also understood of the angles made by the opposite beams adverticem, yet neverthelesse you are here further to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how the incident Beam of B. <hi>viz.</hi> B. F. reflecteth unto C. and so taketh up the whole semicircle A. B. C I. with three sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, viz. A.F.B. B. F. C. and C. F. I. In like manner, if you consider C. to be in a trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Configuration with A. you see that as the opposite beame of A. <hi>viz.</hi> F. I. maketh a Sextile with the incident beame of a Starr at C. <hi>viz.</hi> C. F.</p>
               <p>So <hi>C. F.</hi> being the beam incident of the Star <hi>C.</hi> reflecteth also to the point <hi>B.</hi> and so

               <p>For as in <hi>Musick</hi> there be but three perfect concords, viz. the diapason, diapente, and diatessaron: so in the <hi>Harmony</hi> of the <hi>Beams,</hi> by which the <hi>Genii</hi> come down, there are but three perfect aspects answerable to the <hi>Harmony</hi> of the <hi>Heavens, Spheres and Planets,</hi>

               <p>But there is yet another way of inferring the same, &amp; it is the argument of <hi>Honest Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celsus,</hi> whereby he would conclude, that there is <hi>de facto,</hi> a substance in us distinct from mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>viz.</hi> our own minde. For every reall affection of property being the mode of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:55271:87"/> some substance or other, and reall modes being unconceivable without their subjects, he inferrs that, seeing we can doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any such thing as <hi>body</hi> in the <hi>World;</hi> (by which doubting we seclude Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation from body) there must be some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther substance distinct from the body, to which cogitation belongs, but I must confess this argument will not reach home to <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celsus</hi> his purpose, who would prove in man a substance distinct from his body; for being there may be modes common to more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects then one, and this of Cogitation, may be pretended to be such as is competible as well to substance corporeall as incorporeall, it may be conceived apart from either though not from both.

For it being impossible that there should be any reall mode, which is in no subject, and I clearly conceiving cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

               <head>
                  <hi>Chap. VIII.</hi> How different vertues are infused into severall kinds of things, by the influence of the heavens, Starrs and Planets.</head>
               <p>I Might easily decline this Controversie, by pleading onely, that the entrance of the <hi>Soul</hi> into the <hi>Body,</hi> supposing her pre-exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is as intelligible as in those other two wayes, of Creation and Traduction. For how this newly <hi>Created soule is infused by God,</hi> no man knows, nor how? If it be traducted from the Parents, both their souls contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to their making up a new one; For if
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:55271:88"/> there be dicision of part of the soule of the Male, in the injection of his seed into the Matrix of the Female, and part of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male soule to joyn with that of the Males; besides that the decision of these parts of their soules, makes the soule a discerpible essence, it is unconceivable how these two parts should make up one soule for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant; A thing rediculous at first view: But if there be no decision of any parts of the <hi>Soul,</hi> and yet the <hi>Soul</hi> of the Parent be the cause of the soul of the Childe, it is perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an act of Creation; a thing that all so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber men conclude incompetable to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Creature. It is therefore plainly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible, how any soul should passe from the Parents into the body of the seed of the <hi>Faetus,</hi> to actuate and inform it; but that all inferiour bodies, are exemplified by the superiour <hi>Idea's</hi> or <hi>Genii:</hi> Now we define an <hi>Idea</hi> to be a form above bodies, souls, minds, and to be but one simple, pure, immutable, indivisible, incorporeal and eternal, and that the nature of all <hi>Idea's</hi> is the same.</p>
               <p>Now all <hi>Idea's</hi> proceed from <hi>God,</hi> and are distinguished amongst themselves by some Relative consideration; least whatsoever is in the world should be but one thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any variety, and that they agree in
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:55271:88"/> essence; least God should be a Compound Substance. In the second place (to be very serious) we place them in the very intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible it self, <hi>in the soul of the world,</hi> differing the one from the other by absolute forms; so that all the <hi>Idea's</hi> in God indeed are but one form; but in the <hi>Anima Mundi</hi> they are many: they are placed in the minde of all other things, whether they be joyned to the body, or separated from the body, by a certain participation; and now by degrees are distinguished more and more; we place them in Nature, as certain small seed of forms infused by the <hi>Idea's:</hi> And lastly, we place them in matter as shadows. Here unto may be added, that in the soule of the world, there be as many seminal forms of things, as <hi>Idea's</hi> in the minde of God.</p>
               <p>Now again by these forms, she did in the Heavens, in the Element of Spirits above the Stars, frame to her self shapes also, and stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped upon all these some properties; on these stars therefore shapes and properties, and all vertues of inferiour species, as also their properties depend; so that every species hath its celestial shape or figure that is suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to it; from which also proceeds a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull power of operating, which proper gift, it receives from its own <hi>Idea,</hi> through
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:55271:89"/> the seminal forms of the <hi>anima mundi:</hi> For <hi>Idea's</hi> are not onely essential causes of every species, but are also the causes of every ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which is in the species; such as have a certain and sure foundation not fortuitous nor casual, but efficacious, powerfull and sufficient, doing nothing in vain.</p>

               <p>And these divine powers, which are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused into things are <hi>Lights, Genii</hi> or <hi>Idea's</hi> call them which you will: For the vertue of things depend upon these, because it is the property of the <hi>Soul</hi> to be from one matter extended into divers things; and sometimes
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:55271:93"/> the <hi>soule</hi> of one thing, they say goes out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another: altering it and hindering the operations of it.

               <p>There is therefore such a kinde of Spirit required to be, as it were the <hi>Medium,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Caelestiall Genii</hi> are <hi>Joyned to gross bodyes of red Earth,</hi> and bestow upon them wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:55271:93"/> gifts. This spirit is after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the body of the world, as a <hi>Genius</hi> is in the body of a man: For as the powers of our souls are communicated to the members of the body by the spirit, so also the vertue of the soul of the world is difused through all things by the Quintessence.</p>
               <p>For there is nothing found in the whole world, that hath not a sparke of the vertue thereof; yet it is more, nay, most of all infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed into those things which have received or taken in most of this spirit, now this spirit is received or taken in by the <hi>Rays</hi> of the <hi>Stars,</hi> so farr forth as things render themselves conformable to them; by this <hi>spirit</hi> every property is conveyed into <hi>Herbs, Stones, Metals</hi> and <hi>Animals,</hi> through the <hi>Sun, Moon, Planets,</hi> and through <hi>Stars higher then the Planets:</hi> Now this spirit may be more advantageous to us, if any one knew how to separate it from the <hi>Elements;</hi> or at least to use those things chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which do most abound with this spirit, for these things, in which this spirit is lesse drowned in a body, and less checqued by matter, do more powerfully, and perfectly act, and also more readily generate their like. For in it are all generative and seminary vertues, for which cause, some <hi>Doctors</hi> and <hi>Alchimists</hi> endeavour to separate this spirit
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:55271:94"/> from <hi>Gold,</hi> and make the <hi>Pentarva,</hi> which is easy but very costly, but if it be rightly separated from <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver;</hi> if you shall afterwards project upon any matter of the same kinde, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> any mettall, will presently turn it into <hi>Gold</hi> or <hi>Silver,</hi> and I know how to do that, and have seen it done but we could make no more <hi>Gold,</hi> then the weight of that was, out of which we extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the spirit. For seeing that is an extence forme, and not intence, it cannot beyond its own bounds change an imperfect body into a perfect, which I deny not but may be done by another way.</p>
               <p>Now originally <hi>man</hi> was taken out of the great <hi>World,</hi> as woman was taken out of Man: For man was a piece of <hi>Red earth:</hi> But while I contemplate this strange vertue of the spirit of the world, the power of the soule of the woman comes into my minde; in which there is no such mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure or exaltednesse, that it should be able to act such Miracles, as I may so call them, rather then natural effects: I cannot but be more then usually inclinable to think that the Plastick power and faculty of the soule of the Infant, or whatever accessions there may be from the imagination of the Mother, is not the adaequate cause of the Formation
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:55271:94"/> of the <hi>Faetus;</hi> but if you think this is onely my bare word, read <hi>Orpheus, Synesius,</hi> and <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roaster;</hi> and they will be my Authority for this Doctrine.</p>
               <p>If this be not enough, I will follow the <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of God,</hi> &amp; examine the nature &amp; compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of man: You finde in <hi>Genesis</hi> that <hi>God</hi> made him out of the <hi>Earth;</hi> This is a great mystery, For it is not the <hi>common Pot Clay,</hi> but an other thing, and that of a far better nature: He that knows the subject of the <hi>Philosophical Medicine</hi> and the <hi>Pantacaea,</hi> and other secrets, how to cure all diseases, &amp; raise the Dead to life again, and by consequence know what destroys or preserves the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament of man: And in man are three princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples homogenial with his life, such as can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store his decayes, and reduce his disorders to a <hi>Harmony.</hi> They that are ignorant in this point are not competent <hi>Judges</hi> of <hi>life</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> but <hi>Quacks</hi> and <hi>Pispots Doctors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To unite the soule to the body, the spirit of Nature assists this performance; so we have discovered a cause proportional to so prodigious an Effect: For we may easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the deeply impassionated fancy of the Mother snatches away the <hi>spirit of Nature into Consent,</hi> which spirit may rationally be acknowledged to have a hand in the effor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:55271:95"/> of all vitall Beings in the world, and haply be the onely Agent in forming of all manner of Plants.</p>
               <p>In which kinde, whether she exert her po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in any other <hi>Elements</hi> then <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Water:</hi> I will conclude no further than that there may be a possibility thereof in the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Regions of <hi>Aire</hi> and <hi>Aether;</hi> To the right understanding of which conjecture, some light will offer it self, from what I have said, concerning the visibility and consisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the <hi>Aerial Daemons,</hi> in their occursions one from another.</p>
               <p>But this is not the onely Argument that would move one to think that this <hi>Spirit of Nature</hi> intermeddles with the Efformation of the <hi>Faetus;</hi> for those signatures, <hi>viz. marks, moles</hi> and <hi>Scars,</hi> that are derived from the <hi>Mothers fancy,</hi> in the Act of Conception, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well be understood without this <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis;</hi> For what can be the subject of that Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature? Not the Plastick part of the soul of the Mother.</p>
               <p>For that it is not the Mothers soule that efforms the <hi>Embrio</hi> (as <hi>Epicharmus, Cebes, Psel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> and <hi>Proclus,</hi> ingeniously conjecture, from the manner of the Efformation of <hi>Birds,</hi> which is in their <hi>Eggs,</hi> distinct from the <hi>Hen,</hi> and they may aswel be Hatched without any
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:55271:95"/> Hen at all; a thing I have ordinarily seen both in <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Arabia:</hi> I have seen it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in <hi>Italy</hi> and in <hi>Barbary:</hi>) Now the <hi>Embrio,</hi> for it hath yet no body, nor its <hi>Genius,</hi> for the <hi>Soule;</hi> if we believe <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Boethius,</hi> is not yet present there. But the <hi>Spirit of Nature</hi> or <hi>mediū</hi> is present every where, which is <hi>snatcht</hi> into consent by the force of the Imagination of the Mother, retains the Note, and will be sure to seale it on the body of the Infant.</p>
               <p>For what rude inchoations the soul of the world has begun in the Matter of the <hi>Faetus,</hi> this signature is comprehended in the whole designe; and after compleated by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and operation of the Particular <hi>soule</hi> of the <hi>Infant,</hi> which co-operates conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to the Pattern of the <hi>Soule of the world,</hi> and insists in her footsteps, who having once begun any hint to an entire designe; she is alike able to pursue it in any place, she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every were like, or rather the same in her self: For as our <hi>Genius,</hi> being one, yet, upon the various temper of the <hi>Spirits,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erts her self into various imaginations and conceptions; so the <hi>Genius</hi> of the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same perfectly every where is enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to exert efformative power every where alike, where the matter is exactly the same.</p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:55271:96"/>
               <p>Whence it had been no wonder, if those <hi>Chickens</hi> above mentioned, sometimes mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Hawkes heads,</hi> had been hatched an hundred miles distant from the Hen, whose imagination was disturbed in the act of conception; because the <hi>soul of the world</hi> had begun a rude draught, which it self would as necessarily pursue every where; This opinion therefore of <hi>Plato</hi> is neither irrational nor unintelligible, That the <hi>Anima Mundi</hi> interposes and insinuates into all Generations of things, while the matter is fluid and yeilding, which would induce a man to believe, that she may not stand idle in the transfiguration of the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicles</hi> of the <hi>Genii,</hi> but assist their fancies and desires; and so help to cloath them, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire them according to their own pleasures; or it may be sometimes against their wills, as the unweildinesse of the Mothers fancy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces upon her a monstrous birth.</p>
               <p>Now the soul faln into this low and fatall condition, where she must submit to the course of Nature, and the laws of other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, that are generated hereon Earth, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playes her self by degrees, from smaller di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions to the Ordinary size of men, when as this faculty of contracting and dilating
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:55271:96"/> of themselves is in the very essence and <hi>Idea</hi> of all <hi>Spirits;</hi> as I have written in my se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond book <hi>of the Rosie Crucian Physick,</hi> cap. 3. So she does but that leasurely and naturally now, being subjected to the laws of this <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial Fate,</hi> (as I have noted in <hi>the Idea of the Law</hi>) which she does, exempt from this condition suddenly and freely: Not grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by <hi>juxta</hi> — position of parts, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tromission of matter; but inlarging of her self with the body, meerly by the Dilatation of her own Substance, which is one and the same alwayes. And now I shall speak of the Harmony of mans body, how the soul fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions it.</p>

               <p>MAn in his <hi>Original</hi> was a branch plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in God, and behold he is the most beautifull and perfectest of his works, wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Image yet, and is called the lesser world; Therefore he by a more perfect composition and sweet <hi>Harmony,</hi> and more sublime dignity doth contain and maintain in himself all <hi>Numbers, Measures, Weights, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Elements,</hi> and all other things which are of his Composition.</p>
               <p>And in him, as it were, in the supream workman-ship, all things obtain a certain high condition, beyond the ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonancy, which they have in other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds: From hence in old time, Men did Number by their Fingers, and shewed all Numbers by them: And they seem to prove that from the <hi>very joynts of mans body,</hi> all <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, Measures, Proportions,</hi> and <hi>Harmonies</hi> were <hi>invented and contrived,</hi>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:55271:97"/>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>And according to the Measure of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, is framed <hi>Temples, Palaces, Churches, Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels, Abbeyes, Houses, Theaters;</hi> also <hi>Ships Guns, Engins,</hi> and every kinde of Artifice; and all members of Edifices and buildings, as <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:55271:98"/> Chapiters,</hi> of <hi>Pillars, Basis, Buttresses, Feet</hi> of <hi>Pillars, &amp;c.</hi> Moreover <hi>God</hi> himself taught <hi>Noah</hi> to build the <hi>Arke,</hi> according to the measure of Mans body; and he made the whole Fabrick of the world proportionable to Mans body; therefore it is called the great World, mans body the lesse.</p>
               <p>Therefore al those who have written of the Microcosme or of man, measure the body by six feet, a foot by ten degrees, every degree by five minuites; and thus we number sixty degrees, which make three hundred minuits, to the which are compared so many <hi>Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical Cubits;</hi> by which <hi>Moses</hi> describes the <hi>Arke:</hi> For as the body of man is in length three hundred minuites, in breadth fifty, in height thirty.</p>
               <p>So the length of the <hi>Arke</hi> was three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Cubits, the breadth fifty, and the height thirty; that the proportion of the length to the breadth be six fold, to the height ten fold, and the proportion of the breadth to the height about two thirds: In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Measures of the Members are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate, and consonant both to the parts of the world, and Measures of the <hi>Archetype,</hi> and so agreeing, that there is no member in man, which hath not correspondence with some signe, Star, <hi>Intelligence, Divine name,</hi>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:55271:98"/> sometimes in <hi>God</hi> himself, the <hi>Archetype;</hi> but the whole measure of the body may be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and proceeding from roundnesse, to turn and tend to it again: And the body may be measured many wayes; for example, If a man be placed up right, with his feet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and his Armes stretched forth, he will make a Quadrature equilateral, whose Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre is the bottome of the belly: But if on the same Centre, a Circle be made, by the Crown of the Head, the Arms being let fall so far, till the end of the Fingers touch the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, make as much as the Fingers ends are distant from the top of the head.</p>
               <p>Then they divide that Circle, which was drawn from the Centre of the lower belly, into five equall parts, which do constitute a perfect <hi>Pentagon;</hi> and the heels of the Feet, having reference to the Navile, make a <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle</hi> of equal sides; but if the heels being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, the Feet be stretched forth on both sides, to the right and left, and the hands lifted up to the line of the Head, then the ends of the Fingers and Toes do make a square of equal sides, whose centre is on the Navile; as if a man stood in the middest of a Figure, and his hands made shorter by the fourteenth part of his upright stature; then the distance of his Feet having reference to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:55271:99"/> the lower belly, they will make an equilate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Triangle;</hi> and the Centre being placed in his Navile, a Circle being brought about, will touch the <hi>ends</hi> of the Fingers and Toes: And if the hands be lifted up as high as may be, above the Head, then the Elbows will be equall to the Crown of the Head; and if then the Feet being put together, a man stand streight, he may be put into an equila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral square brought by the extremities of the Hands and Feet.</p>
               <p>The Centre of this square is the Navile, which is the middle betwixt the top of the Head and the Knees; Observe the Compass of a Man under the Arm-pits contains the middle of his length, whose middle is the bottome of his breast, and from thence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the middle of his breast betwixt both duggs, and from the middle of his breast unto the crown of his head, on every side the fourth part: also from the bottome of his breast to the bottome of his knees, and from thence to the bottome of his ankles the fourth part of a man, the same is the latti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the shoulder blades, from one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream to another, the same is the length from the elbow to the end of the lowest fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and therefore this is called a Cubit.</p>
               <p>Thus we count foure Cubits make the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:55271:99"/> length of a man, and one Cubit the breadth, which is in the shoulder blade, but that which is in the compasse one foot; now six hands breaths make a Cubit, foure a foot, and foure finders breadth make a hand breadth, and the whole length of a man is twenty four hand breadths, of six foot, of ninty six fingers breadths, from the bottom of his breasts to the top of his breasts, is the sixth part of his length, from the top of his breast to the top of his forehead and lower-most root of his haires, the seventh part of his length.</p>
               <p>Of a strong and well set body, a foot is the sixth part of the length, but of a tall the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth. Neither can (as <hi>Zoroaster,</hi> and <hi>Jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas</hi> testifie) the talnesse of mans body ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed seven feet, the <hi>Diameter</hi> of his Compass is the same measure, as is from the hand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing shut unto the inward bending of the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, and as that which is from the breast to both duggs, upward to the upper lip, or downward to the navel; and as that which is from the ends of the bones of the upper-most part of the breast, compassing the Gul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, and as that which is from the sole of the foot to the end of the Calfe of the legg, and from thence to the middle whirle bone of the knee, all these measures are co-equall,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:55271:100"/> and make the seventh part of the whole height.</p>
               <p>The head of a man from the bottome of the chin to the crowne of his head, is the eighth part of his length, as also from the elbow to the end of the shoulder-blade: so great is the Diameter of the compasse of a tall man; the Compasse of the head drawn from the top of the forehead, and the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the hinder part of the head, make the first part of his whole length, so much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so doth the breadth of the breasts, nine face breadth make a square well set man, and ten a tall man.</p>
               <p>The length of man therefore being divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into nine parts, the face from the top of the forehead to the bottome of the chin, is one, then from the bottome of the throat, or the top of the breast unto the top of the stomack is another, from thence to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile is a third, from thence to the bottome of the thigh a forth, from thence the hip to the top of the calfe of the legg makes two, from thence to the joynt of the foot makes two more, all which are eight parts.</p>
               <p>The space from the top of the forehead to the crowne of the head, and that which is from the chin to the top of the breast, and that which is from the joynt of the foot, to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:55271:100"/> the sole of the foot, I say these three spaces joyned together make the ninth part; in breadth, the breast hath two parts, and both arms seven, but the body, which ten face breadths make, is the most exactly proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.</p>
               <p>Therefore the first part of this, is from the crowne of the head to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the nose, from thence to the top of the breast, the second; and then to the top of the stomack the third; and from thence to the navile, the fourth; from thence to the privy members the fift; where is the middle of the length of man; from whence to the sole of the feet, are five other parts; which being joyned to the former, make ten whole; by which every body is measured by a proportioned measure. For the face of a man from the bottome of his chin, to the top of his forehead, and bottome of the haire is the tenth part: The hand of a man from the shutting, to the end of the longest finger is also one part; also betwixt the middle of both duggs is one part, and from both to the top of the gullet is an equilaterall trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, the lattitude of the lower part of the forehead from one eare to the other is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part: the latitude of the whole breast,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:55271:101"/>
                  <hi>viz.</hi> from the top of the breasts to the joynt of the shoulder blades, is on both sides one part, which make two; the compasse of the head cross-wise from the distance of the eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>browes by the top of the forehead unto the bottome of the hinder part of the head, where the haire ends, hath also two parts; from the shoulders on the outside unto the coupling together of the joynts of the Hand, and on the inside from the Arme-pits unto the beginning of the palme of the Hand, and of the Fingers, are three parts. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of the Head by the middle of the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head hath three parts; the compasse of the Girdling hath foure parts in a well set man, as (saith <hi>Pomponatius</hi>) but in a thin body three parts and a halfe, or as much as is from the top of the breast to the bottome of the Belly, the compasse of the Breast by the arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit to the Back hath five parts, <hi>viz.</hi> as much as half the whole length from the Crowne of the head to the knurles of the Gullet, is the thirteenth part of the whole altitude; the Armes being stretched upward, the Elbow is even to the Crown of the Head.</p>
               <p>But now let us see how equall the other commensurations are to one the other, as much as the distance is from the chin to the top of the Breast, so great is the latitude of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:55271:101"/> the Mouth, as much as is the distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the top of the breast, to the Navile, so great is the compasse of the Mouth; as much as the distance is from the Chyn to the crown of the head, so great is the latitude of the girdling place; as is the distance from the top of the Nose to the bottome, such is the distance betwixt the chin and the throat; Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the cavity of the eyes from the place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the eye-browes unto the inward cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and the extention of the bottome of the Nose; &amp; the distance from the bottome of the Nose to the end of the upper lip; I say these three are equall amongst themselves, and as much as from the top of the Nayle of the forefinger to the lowermost joynt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and from thence where the hand is joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the arme on the outside, and in the inside from the top of the nayle of the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle finger unto the lowermost joynt, and from thence to the shutting of the hand: I say all these parts are equall amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; the greater joynt of the forefinger, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualls the height of the forehead; the other two to the top of the Nail, equall the Nose; from the top to the bottome, the first and the greater joynt of the middle finger equall the space which is betwixt the end of the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:55271:102"/> Nose to the end of the Chyn, and the second joynt of the middle finger is as much as the distance from the bottome of the Chin to the top of the lower Lip, but the third is from the mouth to the end of the Nose, but the whole hand as much as the whole face.</p>
               <p>The greater joynt of the Thumb is as much as the widenesse of the Mouth, and as the distance betwixt the bottome of the chin and the top of the lower lip, but the lesser joynt is as much as the distance betwixt the top of the lower and the end of the nose; the Nailes are half as much as those joynts, which they call the Nayle joynts, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance betwixt the middle of the eye-browes to the outward corners of the Eyes, is as much as betwixt those corners of the Ears; the height of the Forehead, the length of the Nose, and the widenesse of the Mouth are equall; also the breadth of the Hand and Foot are the same; the distance betwixt the lower part of the Ankle to the top of the Foot is the same, as that betwixt the top of the foot, and the end of the Nayles.</p>
               <p>The distance from the top of the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head to the place bewixt the Eyes, and from that to the end of the Nose; and from thence to the end of the Chin is the same; the Eyebrows <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And therefore the Eyes have two parts of that space, which is betwixt both extremities of the Eyes, a third part the Nose that is betwixt takes up: From the Crown of the Head to the Knees, the Navile is the middle; from the top of the Breast to the end of the Nose, the Knuckle of the Throat makes the middle; from the Crown of the Head to the bottome of the Chin, the Eyes are the middle; from the space betwixt the Eyes to the bottome of the Chin, the end of the Nose is the middle; from the end of the Nose to the bottome of the Chin, the end of the lower Lip is the middle, a third part of the same distance is the upper Lip: And all these Numbers, Measures and Weights are through manifold proportions and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monical consents Consonant one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: For the Thumb is to the Wrist in a circle Measure in a double proportion and a half, for it contains it twice and a half, as five is to two.</p>

               <p>The latitude of them to the latitude of the thigh is half so much again: of the head to the Neck triple, the same to the leg.

               <p>The Motions also of the Members of mens bodies answer to the motions of the <hi>spirits,</hi> that move the <hi>Spheres</hi> upon their <hi>whirling

               </p>
               <p>There is a certain Nerve found by the <hi>Anatomists</hi> about the middle of the Neck-pit, which being touched, doth so move all the members of the body, that every one of them move according to its proper motion: by which like touch <hi>Damabiah kim Cim,</hi> thinks the members of the world are moved by God: And there are two Veins in the Neck, which being held hard, the mans strength failes immediately, and his senses are taken away untill they be loosened.</p>

               <p>Which is a plain detection that the Seat of the Soule, as much as concerns the animal faculties, is chiefly in the Head, the same may be said of <hi>Phrensie,</hi> and <hi>Melancholly,</hi> and such like distempers, that <hi>deprave a mans Imagination and Judgement;</hi> The <hi>Rosie Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> alwayes conclude something amiss with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>

               </p>
               <p>Lastly, if it were nothing but the neare attendance of the outward senses on the <hi>soul,</hi> or her discerning faculty, being so fitly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced about her in the Head; this unlesse there were some considerable Argument to the contrary, should be sufficient to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine any one that is unprejudiced, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that the seat of common Sense, Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But now the greatest difficulty will be to define in what part thereof it is to be placed; in which, unlesse we will go over boldly and carelesly to work, we are to have a regard to Mecanical congruities, and not pitch upon
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:55271:106"/> any thing, that by the Advantage of this supposal, that there is a <hi>Soul</hi> in man, may go for possible: but to chuse what is most handsome and convenient: That the whole Brain is not the seat of <hi>common sense,</hi> appears from the Wounds and Cuts, it may receive without the destruction of that faculty; For they will not take away sense and motion, unlesse they peirce so deep as to reach the <hi>Ventricles of the Brain,</hi> as <hi>Riverius</hi> observes.</p>
               <p>Nor is it in <hi>Hypocrates</hi> his smal solid par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle; for besides, That it is not likely the Centre of perception is so Minute, it is very incougruous to place it in a body so perfectly solid, more hard then <hi>Adamant</hi> or <hi>Iron;</hi> but this Invention <hi>Aristotle</hi> has some where, which is a freak of his <hi>Petulant fancy,</hi> that has an ambition to make a <hi>blunder and confusion of Hypocrates,</hi> and all other <hi>Phylosophers</hi> and <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians, Metaphisical speculations,</hi> collecting some and burning others, making those that read him believe, how though the soule were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but matter; yet it might be incorru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible and immortal; it was not worth the while to take notice of it here in this <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis,</hi> which we have demonstrated to be true, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is a <hi>soul</hi> or <hi>Genius</hi> in the body, whose Nature is material or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal.</p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:55271:107"/>
               <p>Nor are the Membranes in the Head, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Sensorium;</hi> neither those that invelop the Brain (for they would be able then to see the Light, through the whole the <hi>trepan</hi> makes) though the party <hi>trepann'd</hi> winked with his eye: (To say nothing of the conveyance of the Nerves, the Organs of external sense, that carry beyond these exteriour Membranes, and therefore point to a place more inward, that must be the recipient of all their impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses) nor any internal membrane, as that which bids fairest for it, the <hi>Septem Lucidum,</hi> as being in the midest of the upper <hi>Ventricle.</hi>

               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:55271:107"/>
               <p>Of this opinion were the brothers of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie Cross;</hi> which would not be too long to recite here. Now the Authority of these men are not rashly to be refused, neither do I finde any Arguments hitherto that are valid enough to deface it; those that are recited out of <hi>Avenrois, Aristotle, Pomponatius,</hi> and <hi>Cardanius</hi> subscribed too by those learned Authors of <hi>Adenographia,</hi> and the <hi>Hydro piro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magicall Art,</hi> have not in my judgment the force to ruine it, I shall repeat them and then examine them.</p>
               <p>The first is, that this <hi>Glandula</hi> is too little to be able to represent the Images of all that the soul has represented unto her: The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, That the external Nerves do not reach to the <hi>Glandula;</hi> and that therefore it cannot receive the impresse of sensible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: The third, That it is placed in a place of Excrements, which would soile the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of things: The fourth, That the species of things are perceived there, where they are carried by the Nerves; but the Nerves meet about the beginning or head of the <hi>spinal marrow,</hi> a more noble and ample place then the <hi>Glandula pinealis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the first, I answer, That the amplitude of that place where the Nerves meet in the <hi>spinal Marrow</hi> is not large enough to receive
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:55271:108"/> the distinct impresses of all the Objects the <hi>minde</hi> retains in <hi>memory:</hi> Besides, that the other parts of the Brain may serve for that purpose, as much as any of it can; for it is the <hi>Soul</hi> it self alone that is capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining so distinct and perfect representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, though it may make an occasional use of some private marks it impresses in the <hi>Brain;</hi> which haply may be nothing at all like the things it would remember, nor of any considerable magnitude nor proportion to them; such as we observe in the words <hi>Arx</hi> and <hi>Atomus,</hi> where there is no corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondency of either likenesse or bignesse, betwixt the words and the things represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by them.</p>
               <p>To the second, That though there be no continuation of the Nerves to the <hi>Conarion,</hi> yet there is of spirits; which are as able to conveigh the impresses of Motion from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>external sense to the <hi>Conarion,</hi> as the <hi>Aire</hi> and <hi>Aether</hi> the impresse of the <hi>Stars</hi> unto the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ye.</p>
               <p>To the third, That the <hi>Glandula</hi> is conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently enough placed, so long as the body is sound; for no excrementitious humou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s will then overflow it or besmear it; but in such distempers wherein they doe, <hi>Apoplexies, Catalepsies,</hi> or such like diseases will arise;
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:55271:108"/> which we see do fall out, let the seat of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense</hi> be where it will.</p>
               <p>Lastly, I say, that the Nerves, when they are once got any thing far into the <hi>Brain,</hi> are devoyed of <hi>Tunicles,</hi> and be so soft and spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, that the motion of the <hi>Spirits</hi> can play through them; and that therefore they may ray through the sides, and so continue their Motion to the <hi>Conarion,</hi> where ever their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities may seem to tend.</p>
               <p>But though these Arguments do not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently confute the opinion, yet I am not so wedded to it, but I can think something more unexceptionable may be found out, especially it being so much to be suspected, that all animals have not the <hi>Conarion,</hi> (as I have said in my book <hi>Elias Ashmole,</hi> Esq) made publike, by the Title of, <hi>The way to Blisse</hi>) That what pleased <hi>Agrippa</hi> so much in this invention, is that he conceited it such a marvelous fine instrument to beat the animal spirits into such &amp; such pores of the Brain, a thing that I cannot at all close with: For Reasons I have given you in my Book entituled, <hi>A New Method of Rosie Crucian Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick;</hi> besides, that stones have been found in this <hi>Glandula,</hi> and that it is apparent, that it is environed with a Net of Veins and Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which are indications, that it is a part
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:55271:109"/> assigned for some more inferiour office: But yet I would not dismiss it without faire play.</p>
               <p>Wherefore that opinion of <hi>Paracelsus</hi> may warrant the other, who places also the seat of common sense in that part of the <hi>spinal marrow,</hi> where the Nerves are suspected to meet, as it is more plain and simple, so it is more irrefutable, supposing that the soule's centre of perception (whereby she does not onely apprehend all the objects of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal senses, but does imagine Reason, and freely command and determine the spirits into what part of the body she pleases) could be conveniently seated in such dull pasty matter, as the Pyth of the Brain is, a thing, I must needs confesse, that pleases not me; and therefore I will also take leave of this opinion too, and adventure to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, <hi>That the chief seat of the Genius</hi> or <hi>Soule,</hi> where she perceives all objects, where she Imagines, Reasons, and Invents, and from whence she commands all the parts of the body, is those purer <hi>animal spirits</hi> in the fourth Ventricle of the Brain. The proof of this is our simpathizing so sensibly with the changes of the <hi>Aire,</hi> which all the learned <hi>Astrologers</hi> take notice of (but flattering <hi>ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing William Lilly</hi> is not in our Harmony;) for

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:55271:110"/> there will be very great difficulty how there should be so distinct a representation of any visible object, for it is very hard to conceive, that the colours will not be confounded, and the bignesse of the object diminished, and indeed that the <hi>Image</hi> will not be quite lost before it come to the <hi>Genius,</hi> if it be only in the common Sensorium, for it is plain, and experience will demonstrate, that there is a very perfect <hi>Image</hi> of the object in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the eye, which is made by the discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of the lines of Motion from it, thus the line A. B. which stands in roundnesse from the object A. C. bears against that point in the bottome of the eye in B. and the line C. D.</p>

               <p>Against the point D. whereby C. and A. are felt in their place, and in such a distance as they are in the object C. A. and so of all the lines which come from the Object C. A. into the bottome of the eye B. D. from whence the object is felt, in such a length and breadth, as it is capable of being perceived in at such a distance from the eye. And as the motion that is conveyed from A. to B. and from C. to <hi>D.</hi> is felt there: so the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification of it, whereby the objects in those parts may seem <hi>Red, Yellow, Blew, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>loome, Skey-colour, Purple, Orange, Green,</hi> or any other colour, is felt there also, whence it is plaine, that there will be an exquisite impression, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all circumstances of the object, in the bottome of the eye; so that if the <hi>Genius</hi> receive it there, and convey it thence to her centre of perception intirely in the same circumstances, the representation will be compleat. But if the soul be not there, but the conveyance thereof must be left to the bare Lawes of matter, the image will be much depraved or lost, before it can come to the Common Sensorium.</p>
               <p>For this motion must be propagated from B. and D. till it come to the hole E. and so passe into the obtick Nerve, to be carried into the Brain, and so to the seat of common
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:55271:111"/> sense: But betwixt B. and E. or D. and E. there may be the depainture of sundry co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, whence it will be necessary that F. be tinctured with the colour <hi>D.</hi> and <hi>F.</hi> G. with the Colour of both D. and F. and so of the rest of the lines drawn from the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the eye: so that all their colours would be blended before they come to E. Now at that harsh flexure at E where the visuall line is as crooked as B. E. R. accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the experiments of reflection and refraction, the breadth or length of the object C. A. would be lost, for we must needs expect that, as it is in reflexions and refractions, where the object will appeare in that line, that immediately conveyes the sense of it, so here it must be also; and therefore the point C. and A. must appear about Q. whence the object will shrivel up in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner into nothing. And suppose it might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in some tolerable latitude, for all this the brain being an Opake substance, so soon as the motion comes thither, it would be so either changed or lost, that the image could not passe the opacity of it in any splendour of entirenesse.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I do not doubt but that the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage which the Genius perceives, is that in the Eye, and not any other corporeally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:55271:112"/> to the inside of the brain (where co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and figure would be so strangely depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, if not quite obliterated) I mean it is the concourse of the <hi>lucid spirits,</hi> in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the Eye, with the outward light conveyed through the humours thereof, (which is the best sense of <hi>Plato</hi> his <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>But time passes away so hastily, that we must briefly dispatch our work: I therefore in general say, That Sensation is made by the arrival of Motion from the Object to the Organ; where it is received in all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances we perceive it in, and conveyed by the vertue of the Souls presence there, assisted by her immediate instrument the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: (Now the <hi>Genius</hi> that enters the body, is not confined to the common <hi>sensorium,</hi> but does essentially reach all the Organs of the body, And by the continuity of the virtue of these Instruments to those in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>sensorium,</hi> the image of every object as faithfully transmitted thither.</p>

               <p>Reason is so involved together with ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, that we need say nothing of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part by it self. Memory is a faculty of a more peculiar consideration; and if the pith of the Brain contribute to the functions of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny power of the minde (more then by concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Animall spirits) it is to this; but the braine should be stored with distinct I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages (whether they consist of the flexures, of the supposed <hi>Fibrillae,</hi> or the orderly pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of pores, or in a continued modifyed motion of the parts thereof; some in this

               <p>As if a man should tye a string about a friends finger to remember a businesse, that a whole days discourse, it may be, was but little enough to give him full instructions in.

               <p>But whether the Soul act thus or no upon the brain, is a matter of uncertain determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; nor can it be demonstrated by any experiment that I knew fit to make it intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible to <hi>Lilly's Logger head,</hi> and therefore we will containe our selves within, keeping our lights and misteries of the Capacities of the

               <p>And therefore I shall conclude, that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory consists in this, that the soul has acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a greater promptitude to think of this, or that phantasme, with the circumstances thereof, which we raised in her upon some occasion, which promptitude is acquired by either, the often representation of the same phantasme in her, or else by a more vived impresse of it, from its No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he relative sense of having seen it before (which we call Memory) does necessarily emerge upon a fresh representation of the Object.</p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:55271:114"/>
               <p>But forgetfulnesse arises either out of meer desuetude of thinking on such an Object, or on others that are linked in with it, in such a series as would represent it as past, and so make it a proper Object of memory; or else for that the spirits, which the soul uses in all her Functions, be not in a due temper; which may arise from over much coolnesse, or waterishnesse in the Head, to which alone <hi>Hypocrates</hi> ascribes obliviousnesse.</p>
               <p>The last thing I am to consider is <hi>spontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous motion,</hi> which that it is performed by the continuation of the <hi>spirits</hi> from the seat of common sense to the Muscles, which is the grosse engine of Motion, is out of doubt, the manner how it is, we partly feel and see <hi>(i e.)</hi> We finde in our selves a power, at our own pleasure, to move this, or the other member, with very great force; and that the Muscle swels, that moves the part, which is a plain indication of influx of spirits, thither di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected or there guided by our meer will; a thing admirable to consider, and worth our most serious meditation, that this direction of the Impresse of Motion, is made by our meer Will and Imagination of doing so; we know and feel it so intimately, that we can be of nothing more sure, that there is some fluid and subtile Matter, which ordinarily
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:55271:114"/> we call spirits, directed into the Muscle that moves the Member, its swelling dos evidence to our sight; as also the experience that moderate use of good Wine, which supplies Spirits, will make this Motion the more strong: As for the manner, whether there be any such valvalae or no in the Nerve, common to the opposite Muscles, as also in those that are proper to each, it is not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall; this great priviledge of our <hi>Souls</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the Motion of matter thus, is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull enough in either <hi>Hypothesis:</hi> but I look upon the <hi>Fibrous</hi> parts of the muscle, as the maine engine of motion; which the <hi>soul</hi> moistning with that subtle liquor of the <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal spirits,</hi> makes them swell and shrinke, <hi>like Lute strings in rainy weather.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in this chiefly consists, the notable strength of our Limbs in <hi>Spontanious motion,</hi> but for those conceived <hi>Valvalae,</hi> that expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience has not found out yet, nor sufficient reason, they are to wait for admission till they bring better evidence. For the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the animall spirits in this fibrous flesh, and the command of the soul to move, is sufficient to salve all <hi>Phoenomena</hi> of this kinde, for upon the <hi>will,</hi> conceived in the <hi>common sensorium,</hi> that part of the <hi>Soul</hi> that resides in the Muscles, by a power neer a kin
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:55271:115"/> to that, by which she made the body, and the Organs thereof, guides the spirits into such pores and parts, as is most requisite for the shewing the use of this excellent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick.</p>
               <p>And in vertue of some such power as this, doe we so easily walk, though we think not of it, as also breath, and sing, and play on the <hi>Lute, Gittarre</hi> or <hi>Amphorion,</hi> though our mindes be taken up with something else; for custome is another Nature; and though the animal Spirits, as being meerly Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap> cannot be capable of any habits; yet the soule, even that part thereof, that is not cognitive may, and therefore may move the body, though cogitation cease, provided the members be well replenished with spirits, whose assistance in natural motions of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals is so great, that their Heads being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ody for a long time will move as before: As <hi>Domitian</hi> observes in the Flies he catched and in sulted over, which after he had executed his justice upon, would flye about, and use their Wings, a good part of an houre after they had lost their heads: which is to be imputed to the resid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nce of their soule in them still, and the intirenesse of the <hi>animal Spirits,</hi> not easily evapourating through their crustarious Bodies, For it is but
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:55271:115"/> a vulgar conceit to think, that the head being taken off, the soul must presently fly out, like a Bird out of a Basket, when the lid is lifted up.</p>
               <p>For the whole world is as much thronged up with body as where she is; and that tye of the spirits, as yet not being lost, it is a greater engagement to her to be there than any where else. This motion therefore in the Flyes about <hi>July,</hi> that is so perfect and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, I hold to be vitall; but that in the parts of dismembred Creatures, that are lesse perfect, may be usually mechanical.</p>
               <p>I have now so far forth, as it is requisite for my designe considered, the Nature and Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the <hi>Soul;</hi> and have plainly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated, that she is a substance distinct from the Body, and that her very essence is spread throughout all the Organs thereof: As also that the general instrument of all her ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations is the subtile spirits; which though they be not in like quantity &amp; sincerity eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, yet they make al the body so pervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the impresses of objects, that like light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, they passe to the common <hi>sensorium:</hi> For it is not necessary that the <hi>medium</hi> be so fine and tenuious, as the matter where the most subtle motion begins, whence <hi>light passe</hi> through <hi>Aire</hi> and <hi>Water,</hi> though <hi>Aire</hi> alone is not sufficient for such a motion as <hi>Light,</hi>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:55271:116"/> and <hi>Water</hi> almost uncapable of being the seat of the fountain thereof▪ This may serve to illustrate the passages of sense from the membranes (or in what other seat soever the <hi>Spirits</hi> are most subtile and <hi>lucid</hi>) through thicker places of the body to the very centre of perception.</p>
               <p>And thus have I discovered a kinde of Heterogeneity in the <hi>Soul;</hi> and that she is not of the same power every where: For her centre of perception is confined to the fourth Ventricle of the Brain: And if the sensiferous motions we speak of be not faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully conducted thither, we have no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Object. That part therefore of the soul is to be looked upon, as most preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and she not being an independent mass as matter is, but one part resulting from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>) so, I think this part may be called the <hi>Root of the soule,</hi> which apprehension of our will seem the less strange, if we consider that from the highest <hi>Life, viz. The Trinity in Ʋnity, and Ʋnity in Trinity:</hi> There does result that which hath no life nor sense at all, <hi>viz.</hi> the stupid Matter, wherefore in very good Analogy, we may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:55271:116"/> that that precious part of the <hi>Soul</hi> in which resides perception, sense, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, may send forth such an essential emanation from it self, as is utterly devoid of all sense and perception, which you may call, if you will, the <hi>exteriour branches of the Soul,</hi> or the <hi>Rayes or Beams of the Soul;</hi> if you call that nobler and diviner part the <hi>Centre,</hi> which may very well merit also the Appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Eye of the <hi>Soul;</hi> all the rest of its parts being but meer darknesse without it; In which, like another <hi>Cyclops,</hi> it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble the World we live in, whose one Eye is conspicuous to all that behold the light.</p>
               <p>Now next let us prescribe Medicines Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical, or <hi>Rosia Crucian,</hi> wholesome and fit to keep the Body in health and lustinesse, untill the appointed time of Death, that is, when the Soul separates from it; but we will keep them together in good temper a while with these Medicines; and then after we shall teach you the Harmony and Composition of the Humane Soule; and then conduct it to the place from whence it came.</p>

               <p>The Humour or liquor which serves for putrefaction must be proportionable to that body which is to be putrified; the heat which promotes this putrefaction, must be so milde and temperate, that the liquor in which the resolving Salt lyeth, may remain still in and about the matter, and not be laved or eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated from it; the body putrifying, must not be removed out of that Matrix, in which the putrifaction was begun, untill that which is intended be fully perfected; the more pure the Matrix is, the thing generated is by so much the more perfect and sound; that Matrix is onely convenient and adapted to Generation, which permits an easie entrance to the seed.</p>

               <p>But to hasten to the <hi>Harmony</hi> of the <hi>Soul,</hi> we must inquire into it by those <hi>mediums</hi> by which it passeth to us <hi>(i. e.)</hi> by celestial bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and <hi>spheres,</hi> knowing therefore what are the powers of the <hi>soul,</hi> to which the <hi>Planets</hi> answer, we shall by those things, which have been spoken of before, the more easily know their agreements amongst themselves; For the <hi>Moon</hi> governs the Powers of Increasing and Decreasing; the phantasie and wits de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on <hi>Mercury,</hi> the Concupiscible virtue on <hi>Venus,</hi> the Vital on the <hi>Sun;</hi> the Irascible on <hi>Mars;</hi> the Natural on <hi>Jupiter;</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive on <hi>Saturn;</hi> but the Will as the <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum mobile,</hi> and the guide of all these powers at pleasure, being joyned with the superiour intellect, is always tending to good; which intellect indeed doth alwayes shew a path<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to the Will, as a Candle to the Eye; but it moves not it self, but is the Mistresse of her own operation, whence it is called Freewill; and although it alwayes tends to good, as an object suteable to it self; yet sometimes
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:55271:127"/> being blinded with errour, the animal po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer forcing it, it chooseth evill believing it to be good.</p>
               <p>Therefore Will is defined to be a faculty of the intellect and Will, whereby good is chosen by the help of Grace, and Evill not assisting; Grace therefore which Divines call Charity, or infused love, is in the Will, as a first Mover, which being absent, the whole consent fals into dissonancy; More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the <hi>soul</hi> answers to the <hi>Earth</hi> by <hi>sense,</hi> to the <hi>Water</hi> by <hi>Imagination,</hi> to the <hi>Aire</hi> by <hi>Reason,</hi> to the <hi>Heaven</hi> by the <hi>Intellect,</hi> and the soul goes out into a <hi>Harmony</hi> of them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording, as these are tempered in a mortall body.</p>
               <p>The wise <hi>Plato</hi> knowing that the Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious dispositions of <hi>bodyes</hi> and <hi>souls</hi> are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, according to the diversity of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions of men, did not in vain use musical sounds and singings, as to confirme the <hi>Health</hi> of the <hi>body,</hi> and restore it being lost.

               <p>And my Father <hi>Francis Heydon</hi> with one Mr. <hi>Blackmore</hi> in the year 1644. beheld the hand of <hi>Almighty God, with a sword drawn and shaking it over the West,</hi> it appeared wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full glorious with part of the Arm, very fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and furious, it was in its motion striking every way all that night, and a few dayes after they heard <hi>Essex</hi> and his Army were routed by the Angel of Almighty God: for

For it is a thing rediculous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of an <hi>Astronomer, Astrologer, Geoman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi> or <hi>Phylosopher</hi> to judge the measure of corporeal matter, by what it seems to our sight; for so <hi>Ayre</hi> would be nothing at all; or what it is to our handling, or weighing of it; for so indeed a <hi>Cup</hi> of <hi>Quickesilver</hi> would seem to have infinitely more matter in it, then one filled with <hi>Aire</hi> onely, and a ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of <hi>Water</hi> less when it is plunged under the <hi>Water</hi> in the River, then when it is carried in the <hi>Ayre;</hi> but we are to remember, that let matter be of what consistency it will, as thin &amp; pure as the flame of a Candle; there is not lesse of corporeal Substance therein, than there is in the same dimensions of <hi>Silver, Lead</hi> or <hi>Gold.</hi>

               <p>Seeing its demostrated that Genii have solid bodies, and the place of the <hi>Soul</hi> or <hi>Genius</hi> abode is the <hi>Aire,</hi> and the <hi>Vehicles</hi> of the <hi>Genii</hi> or <hi>Souls</hi> deceased is the <hi>Aire;</hi> nor can the <hi>Souls Vehicle be</hi> incommodated by storms of Winde; and yet <hi>Rain, Haile, Snow</hi> and <hi>Thunder</hi> will incommodate her lesse: For they passe as they doe through other parts of the Aire which close again imediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and leave neither wound nor scare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde them: Wherefore all these Meteors
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:55271:133"/> Mr. <hi>John Gadbury</hi> speaks of, may in their mediocrity be a pleasure to her and refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and in their excesse no long pain, nor in their highest rage any destruction of Life at all: From whence we may safely conclude, that not onely the upper Region, but this lower also, may be inhabited both by the deceased <hi>Souls</hi> of Men and by <hi>Daemons.</hi> And though we cannot see these <hi>Aerial Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> yet they may not misse of seeing us; and that it may be, from a mighty distance, if they can transform their Vehicle, or the Organ of sight, into some such advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Figure, as is wrought in Dioptick Glasses, which power will infinitely exceed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting and dilating of the pupill of our Eye; which yet is a weaker and more defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitious attempt towards so high a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as we speak off; which notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may seem very possible in spirits, the same may be said of their hearing: For the same principle may enable them to shape themselves Organs, for the receiving of sounds, of greater Art and Excellency, than the most accurate acconstick we read of, or can excogitate: Wherefore it is a very childish mistake to think that because we do not every day see the shape, nor hear the discourse of Spirits, that they neither hear
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:55271:133"/> nor see us: For soft bodies are impressible by hard ones, but not on the contrary; as mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted wax will receive the signature of the seal, but the seal is not at all impressed upon by the Wax. And so solid a body will stop the course of Aire, but the Aire will not stop the course of a solid body, and every inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable terrestrial consistency will reflect light, but light scarce moves any terrestrial bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy out of its place, but is rebounded back by it; that therefore that is most tenuious and thin is most passive; and therefore if it be once the Vehicle of sense, is most sensible whence it will follow, that the reflection of light from Objects being able to move our Organs that are not so fine, they will more necessarily move those of the <hi>Genii,</hi> and at a greater distance; but their bodies being of <hi>Diaphanous Aire,</hi> it is impossible for us to see them, unlesse they will give themselves the trouble of reducing them to a more terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striall Consistency, whereby they may <hi>reflect Light;</hi> nor can we easily hear their ordinary speech, partly because a very gentle Motion of the Aire will act upon their Vehicles, and partly because they may haply use the finer and purer part of that Element in this Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, which is not so fit to move our sense: and therefore unlesse they will be heard <hi>da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tâ
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:55271:134"/> operâ,</hi> naturally that impresse of the <hi>Aire</hi> in their usuall discourse can never strike our Organ.</p>
               <p>And that we may not seem to say this for nought, that they will have hearing as well as seeing, appears from what I have intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted above, that this faculty is ranged near the <hi>Common Sensorium</hi> in the Vehicle, as well as in that of sight; and therefore the <hi>Vehicle</hi> being all <hi>Aire,</hi> such percussions of it as cause the sence of sound in us, will necessarily do the like in them; but more accurately, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if they Organize their <hi>Vehicle</hi> for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, which will answer to the arrection of the ears of animalls, for the better taking in the sound.</p>
               <p>And they have the sense of touch, else how could they feel resistance, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in the bearing of one body against another, because they are impenetrable? And to speak freely, my thoughts, it will be a very hard thing to disprove that they have not something analogicall to <hi>Smel</hi> and <hi>Taste,</hi> which are very neare of kin to <hi>Touch</hi> proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so called. For <hi>Fumes</hi> and <hi>Odours</hi> passing so easily through the <hi>Aire,</hi> will very Naturally insinuate into their <hi>Vehicles</hi> also: which fumes, if they be groser and humectant, may raise that Diversification of touch, which we
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:55271:134"/> Mortalls call Tasting: if more subtle and dry, that which we call <hi>Smelling,</hi> which if we should admit, we are within modest bounds, as yet in Comparison of others: as <hi>Cornelius Agrippa,</hi> who affirms down right that the <hi>Arial Genii</hi> are Nourished, and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> sayes so too, and some of them get into the bodyes of Animalls to batten them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves there in their <hi>blood</hi> and <hi>spirits,</hi> which is also averred by <hi>Zadich,</hi> who tells us that the purer sort of <hi>Genii are Nourished by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Aire, as our spirits are in the Nerves and Arteries,</hi> &amp; that other <hi>Genii</hi> of a courser kinde, suck in moisture, not with the mouth as we doe, but as a sponge does water: and <hi>Almadir</hi> Writes concerning the <hi>Zabii,</hi> that they eat of the blood of their Sacrifice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they thought it was the food of the <hi>Daemons</hi> they worshipped, and that by eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof, they were in a better capacity to communicate with them, which things if they could be believed, that would be no such hard Probleme concerning the bodies of Spirits and Souls departed.</p>
               <p>It is certain that <hi>Genii</hi> and <hi>Ghosts</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> have the <hi>sence</hi> of <hi>Hearing, Seeing</hi> and <hi>Touching</hi> and not improbably of <hi>Smelling</hi> and <hi>Tasting,</hi> which faculties being granted, they need not be much at a losse, how to spend their

               <p>Thus have I shewed that <hi>Genii</hi> converse in humane shape, yet they are sometimes visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to us, under some <hi>Animal shape,</hi> which questionlesse is much more difficult to them then that other visibility is: But this is also possible, though more unusuall by farr, as being more unnaturall. For it is possible by Art to <hi>compresse Aire</hi> so, as to reduce it to <hi>visible oparity,</hi> and has been done by some of my <hi>Pupiles;</hi> the Aire getting this oparity by squeezing the <hi>Globuli</hi> out of it: which though the separate <hi>Souls</hi> and <hi>Spirits</hi> may do by that derective faculty, yet surely it would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty painfull. For the first Element lying
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:55271:140"/> bare, if the <hi>Aire</hi> be not drawn exceeding close, it will cause an ungratefull heat: and if it be, as unnaturall a cold: and so small a moment wil make the first Element too much or too little, that it may haply be very hard at least for these inferiour spirits, to keep stedily in a due mean. And therefore, when they appeare, it is not unlikely but that they soak their <hi>Vehicles</hi> in the vaporous glutinous moisture the <hi>Rosie Crucians</hi> speak off, that they may become visible to us at a more easy rate, and alwayes the better sort appeare in humane shape.</p>

               <p>For though there be neither lust, nor dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of sex amongst these <hi>Genii</hi> (whence the kindest commotion of minde will never be any thing else, but an exercise of intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuall love, whose object is vertue and beauty;) yet it is not improbable, but that there are some generall strictures of discri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of this beauty into <hi>Masculine</hi> and <hi>Faeminine:</hi> partly, because the temper of their <hi>Vehicles</hi> may encline to this kinde of pulchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude rather then that; and partly because se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of these <hi>aerial spirits</hi> have sustained the difference of <hi>sex</hi> in this life; some of them here having been <hi>Males,</hi> others <hi>Females:</hi> and therefore their History being to be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their departure hence, they ought to retaine some Character; especially so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall a one, of what they were here; And it is very harsh to conceit, that <hi>Frost</hi> will meet Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi>'s Wife in the other world, in any other forme then that of a Woman: Although not with so much pleasure there as here; Whence a necessity of some slighter distinction of habits, and manner of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their haire will follow, which dresse, as that of the Masculine Mode, is easily fitted to
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:55271:141"/> them by the power of their will and imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</p>
               <p>Now the immediate instrument of the <hi>soul</hi> in this life is the <hi>spirits,</hi> which are very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous to the body of <hi>Angels,</hi> and that all our passions and conceptions are either sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested from them, or imprest upon them; he cannot much doubt, but that all his faculties of <hi>Reason, Imagination and Affection,</hi> for the generall, will be in him in the other state, as they were here in this, namely that he will be capable of <hi>Love,</hi> of <hi>Joy,</hi> of <hi>Grief,</hi> of <hi>Anger;</hi> that he will be able to imagine, discourse, to remember, and the rest of such oppera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as were not proper to the fabrick of this earthly body, which is the officine of death and generation.</p>
               <p>And the Animall life is as essentiall to the Soul as Union with a body, which she is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver free from; it will follow, that there be some fitting gratifications of it in the other World.

What mischeif men may create to themselves in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World by their zealous mistakes in this, the unspeakable torments of Conscience, worse than death, and not to be avoided by dying: Of the spirit of Nature, what it is?

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:55271:144"/> life; whereby she may again become obnoxious to death: That the Aethereral Vehicle instates the <hi>Genius</hi> in the everlasting <hi>blisse and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
               <p>I Shall next speak to you of the <hi>Policy</hi> of the <hi>Aiery Genii,</hi> concerning which, that in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral there is such a thing among them, I have proved <hi>in my Idea of the Law, the second Book,</hi> to be the most assuredly true in it self, and of the most use to us to be perswaded of; to know their particular Orders and Customes is a more needlesse curiosity: But that they doe lie under the restraint of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> is not onely the opinion of the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagorians</hi> (who hath even to the nicity of Grammatical criticisme, assigned distinct names to the Law, that belongs to these three distinct ranks of beings, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, calling the law that belongs to the first <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but it is also the easie and obvious suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ordinary Reason, that it must needs be so, and especially amongst the <hi>Aerial Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nii</hi> in these lower Regions, they being a mixt rabble of good and bad, wise and foolish, in such a sense we may say, the inhabitants of the earth are so; and therefore they must naturally fall under a <hi>Government,</hi> and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:55271:144"/> to <hi>Law,</hi> as well and for the same Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as men do. For otherwise they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tollerably subsist, nor enjoy what rights may some way or other appertain to them, for the <hi>souls</hi> of <hi>Men</hi> deceased and the <hi>Daemons,</hi> being endued with corporeall sense, and therefore capable of pleasure and paine, and consequently, of both injury and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is manifest, that having the use of reason, they cannot faile to mould them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into some <hi>politicall</hi> forme or other, and so to be divided into Nations and Provinces, and have their <hi>Kings, Princes, Dukes, Earles, Lords; Knights, Esquires,</hi> and <hi>Officers</hi> of <hi>State, Judges, Serjeants, Counsellors, Recorders, Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daryes, Phillizers, Prothronitores, Barresters Clerks, Atturneys, Solicitors, Justices</hi> of <hi>Peace, Constables, Head Borrowes</hi> and all others, to the very lowest and most abhorred <hi>Executioners of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice Bayliffs, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>In the Flesh there is three thousand <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> that keep and preserve mortall men (as I said in the last Chapter) their names you shall finde by this Table following entring with some sacred, Divine or <hi>Angelicall</hi> name,

               <p>And if you enter <hi>the left-hand</hi> it is for <hi>evill</hi> you will finde the name of that <hi>lying spirit,</hi> the tempter or ensnarer of you; but you have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to yeeld to whom you please, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but to come to the <hi>soule</hi> in the <hi>Aireal Region,</hi> where I left her; we will there give her the same name which the deceased had here, unlesse there be some special reason to change it; so that their persons will be as punctually di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguisht, and cirucmscribed as any of ours in this life: All which things, as they are most probable in themselves, that they will thus naturally fall out; so they are very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for administration of <hi>Justice,</hi> and <hi>keeping of order in the other State:</hi> and thus we finde her name.</p>
               <p>In the Table, before you are taught how to calculate the names of <hi>Genii,</hi> good and bad under the presidency of the Seven <hi>Planets,</hi> and these coelestial <hi>Angels are servants of the stars;</hi> as the stars are guided by their Angels, and as man is guided by his spirit; now those of the lower order may be procured and conveyed to us, and all those on the right hand are good and entring, and of the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:55271:149"/> Element of <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Aire:</hi> And if you enter the Table on the left side, those are evill and going out, and of the Element of the <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>Earth;</hi> yet if you finde by your Figures of <hi>Geomancy</hi> and <hi>Astrology</hi> the nature of your <hi>Genius</hi> to be Watery or Earthly by the signes of the Angles and Aspects, on the right hand it is good; And if on your left you enter, and finde a Figure of the <hi>Fire</hi> or <hi>Aire,</hi> it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, because you enter on the left hand: And as there is a <hi>Harmony</hi> of the <hi>Heavens,</hi> so there is a harmony of the <hi>Elements</hi> in their mixions as Earth becomming dirty, being dissolved becomes water, and the same being made thick and hard, become Earth again; but being inaporated through heat, passeth into Aire, and that being kindled, passeth into Fire; and this being extinguished, returns back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into Aire, but being cooled again after its burning, becomes earth, or stone, or sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur; and this is manifested by Lightning: Now the Earth never changes, but relents and is mixed with other Elements, which do dissolve it, but it returns back into it self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; but their qualities are these, Fire is hot and dry, Earth dry and cold, Water cold and moist, the Aire moist and hot; Earth and Water are heavy, Fire &amp; Aire are Light, which
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:55271:149"/> make this Active, and yet Passive; and again, there are three other qualities assigned to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Fire, Brightnesse, thinnes and Motion, but to the Earth, Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Thicknesse &amp; Quietnesse; now the other Elements borrow their qualities from these; so that the Aire receives two qualities of the Fire, thinnesse, motion, and one of the Earth, <hi>viz.</hi> Darknesse; The Water receives in like manner, two qualities of the Earth, darkness and thicknesse, and on the Fire, <hi>viz.</hi> motion; but Fire is twice more thin than Aire, thrice more movable, and fouretimes more bright.</p>
               <p>And the Aire is twice more bright, thrice more thin, and four times more movable then Water; wherefore Water is twice more bright then Earth, thrice more thin, and four times more moveable: As the Fire is to the Aire, so Aire to the Water, and Water to the Earth; and again, as the Earth is to the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, so the Water to the Aire, and the Aire to the Fire: Now by this Table following, and Sixteen Figure, viz. <hi>Aquisitio, Albus, Populus, via, Conjunctio, Carcer, Fortuna major, Puella, Puer, Fortuna minor, Amissio, Laetitia, Rubeus, Tristitia, Caput Draconis, Cauda Draconis,</hi> of the Earth or Geomancy, they foreknow future things by the motions of the Earth; by noise
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:55271:150"/> swellings, tremblings, chops, pits, exhalations and other impressions of points, which have a certain power in the fall of them; as the <hi>Idea's</hi> and Spirits guide them to this or that: Now you must know that the <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> live, as well as <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Aire;</hi> for of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves they generate, vivifie, nourish and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease innumerable Trees, Plants and living Creatures; as most manifestly appeares in things that breed of their own accord, and in those which have no corporeal seed; and these are generated by the soul of the Earth, or Water, and these soules have reason, is apparent; for whereas the universall works of the aforesaid soules doe with a perpetual order conspire amongst themselves, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that they be governed not by chance but by reason; by which reason they doe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, and bring all their operations to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty: For it is necessary that the Earth should have the Reason of terrene things, and Watery of Watery things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, each in their time, place and order, are generated, but being hurt, are repaired, and the perfection of a body is its soul; And it is said, a man staying long under Water, was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up dead, but by letting him blood he revived again: We read of <hi>Virgil</hi> a <hi>Spanish</hi> Earle, <hi>Aniela, Gabienus, Tubero,</hi> and a certain
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:55271:150"/>
                  <hi>Babylonian</hi> that were dead, whom they say, beyond all expectation, the <hi>Physitians</hi> with <hi>Draggon wort</hi> restored to life; others say they were restored by <hi>Honey in a Medicine:</hi> Now there are signes given, whereby it may be known who are alive, although they seem to be dead, green and stink; and indeed will dye unlesse there be means used to recover them; And this is the manner we understand <hi>Rosie Caucians raise the dead:</hi> Now they raise <hi>Birds, Dogs, Horses, Flowers</hi> otherwise, by burning their bodies to Ashes, and then restore them to life. And again, you must understand, as every Region in the Coelestials hath a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>star</hi> and <hi>coelestial image,</hi> which hath influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon it before others: so also in super-coelestials doth it obtain a certain intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence set over it, and guarding it with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite other ministring Spirits of its order, which are all called <hi>Sons of the God of Hosts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But evill Spirits doe wander up and down in this inferiour world, enraged against all, whom they therefore call <hi>Devils;</hi> of whom St. <hi>Austine</hi> in his first Book of the Incarnation of the word to <hi>Januarius</hi> saith: Concerning the Devil and his Angels, contrary to vertues the Ecclesiastical preaching hath taught; that there are such things: but what they are and how they are, he hath not clear enough ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded?
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:55271:151"/> Yet there is this opinion amongst most, that this Devill was an Angel, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made an Apostate, perswaded very many of the Angels to decline with himself, who even unto this day are called his Angels. The <hi>Church</hi> notwithstanding thinketh not that all these are damned, nor that they are all purposely evill, but that from the Creation of the world, the Dispensation of things is ordained by this means, that the tormenting of sinfull soules is made over to them; The <hi>Cardinals of Rome</hi> say, that not any Devil was created evill, but that they were driven and cast forth of <hi>Heaven,</hi> from the orders of good Angels, for their Pride, whose fall not onely our <hi>Bishops, Divines, and Hebrew Theologions,</hi> but also the <hi>Assyrians, Arabians, Aegyptians</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi> doe confirm by their Tenents.</p>
               <p>Every man hath a good and a bad spirit at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends him, and a threefold good <hi>Genius,</hi> as a proper keeper or preserver, the one whereof is holy, another of the nativity, and the other of profession, the <hi>Holy Genius</hi> is one accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Doctrine of the <hi>Rosie Crucians</hi> assigned to the rationall soul, not from the Starrs or Planets, but from a supernaturall cause, <hi>from God himself the president of Genii,</hi> being universall above nature: This doth direct the life of the soul, and doth alwayes
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:55271:151"/> put good thoughts into the minde, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes active in illuminating us, although we do not take notice of it; but when we are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, and live peaceably, then it is percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by us, then it doth speak with us, and communicate its voice to us▪ being before si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and studying dayly to bring us to a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred perfection, also by the aid of this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius we may avoid the malignity of a fate; now the Genius of the Nativity, doth here descend from the disposition of the world, and from the circuits of the Stars and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, which were powerfully dignified in the Nativity; &amp; there be some say when the soul is comming down into the body, it doth out of the quire of the Angels naturally chose a preserver to it self, nor only choose this guide to it self, but hath that willing to defend it, this being the exemptor, &amp; keeper of the life doth help it to the body, and helps a man to that very office, to which the celestials have deputed him being borne; the Genius of profession is given by the Stars, to which such a profession, or sect, which any man hath professed, is subjected, which the soul when it began to make choice

               <p>If any be so curious as to demand, what kinde of punishment this people of the <hi>Aire</hi> inflict upon their Malefactours, I had rather refer them to <hi>Psellus Plotinus, The Auditor of Anebo</hi> and <hi>Cornelius Agrippa,</hi> then descend to such particularities, They say, the <hi>Caverns of the earth</hi> are made use of for Dungeons for the wicked <hi>Daemons,</hi> to be punished in; as if the several <hi>Volcano's,</hi> such as <hi>Aetna, Strumbulo, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cla, Mongebel, Vesuvius,</hi> the <hi>Gulph of Persia,</hi> where they say <hi>Judas</hi> hail's all ships that saile upon those Seas, and tels them, there he is punished for betraying his <hi>Lord and master Jesus Christ, the Son of God, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That there is a tedious restraint upon them, for villanies committed, and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable, is without all question; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing endued with <hi>corporeal sense,</hi> and that more quick and passive than ours; and therefore more subject to the highest degrees of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: So that not onely by incarcerating them, and keeping them in by a <hi>Watch,</hi> in the <hi>Caverns of burning mountains,</hi> where the heat of those Infernal <hi>Chambers,</hi> and the steam of Brimstone cannot but excruciate them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, but also by commanding them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to sundry other hollows of the ground, noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some

But how these confinements &amp; torments are inflicted on them, and by what degrees and relaxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is a thing neither either to determine, nor needfull to understand: Wherefore we will surcease from pursuing any further, so unprofitable a subject, and come to the third general head, we mentioned, as being most <hi>Harmonical</hi> to our discourse, which is, what the <hi>morral condition</hi> of the soul is, when she has left this body.</p>
               <p>These things therefore premised, it will not be hard to conceive, how the condition of the <hi>Soul</hi> after this life, depends on her moral deportment here; for <hi>memory ceasing not, Conscience may very likely awaken</hi> more fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously then ever, the mind becoming a more clear <hi>Judge</hi> of evill actions past, then she could be in the <hi>Flesh,</hi> being now stript of all those circumstances of things that kept her off from the opportunity of calling her self to account, or of perceiving the uglinesse of her own wayes.</p>

               <p>Besides, there being that communication and <hi>Harmony</hi> betwixt the <hi>Earth</hi> and the <hi>Aire,</hi> that at least the fame of things will <hi>arive</hi> to their cogniscance that have left this life; the after ill successe of their wicked enterpr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This is the state of such soules as are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of a sense of dislike of their past actions. And a man would think they need no other punishment then this, if he considered the mighty power of the Minde over her own <hi>Ʋe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle,</hi> and how vulnerable it is from its self. These Passions therefore of the <hi>Genius</hi> that follow an ill Conscience, must needs bring her <hi>Aiery body</hi> into intollerable distempers, worse than <hi>Death</hi> it self.</p>
               <p>Nor yet can she dye, if she would, neither by <hi>Fire</hi> nor <hi>Sword,</hi> nor any means imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; no not if she should fling her self into the flames of <hi>smoaking Aetna;</hi> for suppose she could keep her self so long there, as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure that hideous pain of destroying the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:55271:155"/> Congruity of her <hi>Vehicle</hi> by that Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus fire: She would no sooner be released, but she would catch life again in the <hi>Aire,</hi> and all the former troubles and vexations would return; besides the overplus of these pangs of Death. For <hi>Memory would return, and an ill Conscience would return, and all those busie Furies;</hi> those disordered passions which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it. And thus it would be, though the <hi>Genius</hi> should kill her self, ten thousand times she could but pain and punish her self, not destroy her self.</p>
               <p>I had now finished this Chapter, did I not think it convenient to speak of the spirit of Nature, which is a substance incorporeal, but without sense and animadversion, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading the whole matter of the Universe, and exercising a plastical power therein, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the sundry predispositions and occasions in the parts it works, upon raising such <hi>Phoenomena</hi> in the world, by directing the parts of the Matter and their Motion, as cannot be resolved into meere mechanical powers: And I prove there is such a spirit by the sympathy betwixt <hi>Astral</hi> and <hi>Earthly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;</hi> for the <hi>Genii</hi> of men leaving their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and appearing in shapes, <hi>suppose of Cats, Pigeons, Conies, Stars, flames of Fire,</hi> sometimes of <hi>Men,</hi> and that whatsoever hurt befals

               <p>As if their <hi>Astral bodies</hi> be scalded, woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded have the back broke, the same certainly happens to their <hi>earthly bodies;</hi> And thus the spirit of <hi>Nature</hi> is snatcht into consent with the <hi>imagination of the Genii in these Astral bodies</hi> or <hi>Aeiry Vehicles,</hi> which act of imagination must needs be strong in them; it being so set on, and assisted by a quick and sharp pain, and fright in these scaldings, woundings and stroaks on the back; some such thing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening here, as in women with childe, whose fancy made keen by a sudden feare, have deprived their children of their Arms, yea and of their heads too.</p>
               <p>And this spirit of <hi>Nature</hi> directs the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Aetherial Particles</hi> to act upon these grosser bodies, to drive them towards the <hi>Earth:</hi> for that surplusage of agitation of the <hi>Globular particles</hi> of the <hi>Aether,</hi> above what they spend in turning the <hi>Earth</hi> about, in <hi>Harmony</hi> to the <hi>heavens</hi> is carried every way indifferently, according to his own concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; by which motion the drops of liquors are formed into round Figures; from whence it is apparent, that a <hi>Bullet of Iron, Silver, or
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:55271:156"/> Gold, placed in the Aire,</hi> is equally assalted on all sides by the occursion of these <hi>aetherial par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,</hi> and therefore will be moved no more downwards then upwards; but hang in <hi>ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilibrio,</hi> as a peice of Cork rests on the water, where there is neither winde nor stream, but is equally played against by the Particles of water on all sides.</p>
               <p>I shall demonstrate what I have said, that heavy bodies in the very clime where we live, will not descend perpendicularly to the Earth, and this will be evident to the Eye<figure/>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:55271:156"/> and to Reason, that the proportion of their declination from a perpendicular in any E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levation of the Pole: In the Circle there <hi>A. B. D.</hi> let the Aequator be <hi>B.D.</hi> and from the point <hi>C.</hi> draw a line to <hi>E</hi> parallel to <hi>B. D</hi> which line <hi>C.

The Earth moves, I do not deny; but I wish he could argue or Reason it better, for say I, <hi>E. F.</hi> declines from the line <hi>H.F.</hi> drawn per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular to the Horizon <hi>L. K.</hi> two third parts of a right angle, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> 60. degrees. For the <hi>E. F. H.</hi> is equall to <hi>C F.K.</hi> which again is equall to the alternate angle <hi>B.G.F</hi> which is two third parts of a right angle <hi>ex thesi,</hi> whence it is plain that <hi>E. F.</hi> declines from a perpendicular no lesse than 60. degrees. By the same reason, if we had drawn the scheam for the Elevation of 50. which is more sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then our Clime, I might demonstrate that the descent of heavy bodies, declines from a perpendicular to the <hi>Horizon</hi> 50. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, or five ninthes of a right angle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:55271:157"/> From whence it will follow, that men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not walk upright, but declining, in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation suppose of 60. degrees as neer to the ground as <hi>E. F.</hi> is to <hi>F L.</hi> and much neerer in the more remote parts of the North; and there is proportionably the same reason in other Climes, if we draw a Scheam for the parallel, under which we live, suppose about 52. degrees of Elevation we might represent truly to the Eye, in what posture men would walk upon the <hi>Royal Exchange, London, Oxford,</hi>

               <p>Add unto all this, that if the motion of grosse bodies were according to meer Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical laws; a Bullet, suppose, of Lead or Gold, cast up into the Aire, would never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend again, but would persist in a rectiliner motion, for it being far more solid than so much <hi>Aire</hi> and <hi>Aether</hi> put together, as would fill its place, and being moved with no lesse swiftnesse then that wherewith the <hi>Earth</hi> is carryed about in twenty four houres, it must needs break out in a streight line through the thin <hi>Aire,</hi> and never return again to the <hi>Earth;</hi> but get away as a Commet does out

               <p>Now the most notable of those Offices that can be assigned to the <hi>Spirit of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and that sutable to his name, is the translocation of the souls of Beasts into such Matter as is most fitting for them, he being the common <hi>Proxinet</hi> or <hi>Contractor</hi> of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Matches and Marriages, betwixt Forms and Matter; For <hi>Materia appetit formum ut faemina virum,</hi> this spirit therefore may have not onely the power of directing the Motion of Matter at hand, but also of transporting of particular Souls &amp; Spirits in their silence, and in activity to such matter as they are in, a fitnesse to catch life in again: which trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation or transmission may be very well at immense distances, the effect of this sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy, and coactivity being so great in the working of the <hi>Wines</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> when the <hi>Vines are in the Flower at the Canaries, Tenneriff, Medera</hi>'s or any place in <hi>Spaine, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>The fear and abhorrency therefore we have of <hi>Death,</hi> and the sorrow that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies it, is no argument, but that we may live after it, and are by due affections for those that are to be Spectators of the great <hi>Tragick Comedy of the World;</hi> the whole plot whereof being <hi>an Harmony of the Spheres, Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets</hi> and <hi>Influenciary beams,</hi> being contrived by <hi>Infinite Wisdome and Goodnesse,</hi> we cannot but surmise that the most sad representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are but a shew, but the delight real to such as are not <hi>wicked and impious;</hi> and that what the ignorant call evill in this Universe, is but as the shadowy stroks in a faire Picture; or the mournfull notes in Musick, by which the beauty of the one is more lively and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse, and the melody of the other more pleasing and melting.</p>
               <p>I have now conducted the soul into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther state, and installed her into the same condition with the <hi>Aerial Genii,</hi> but seeing that those that take any pleasure at all in thinking of these things, can seldone com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the ranging of their thoughts, within what compasse they please, and that it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious for them to doubt whether the <hi>Genius</hi> can be secure of her permanency in life in the other world, (it implying no contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that her vital congruity, appropriate to
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:55271:160"/> this or that Element, may either of it self ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, or that she may by some carelesse debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate one congruity, and awaken another in some measure; so make her self obnoxious to fate) we cannot but think it in a manner necessary to extricate such difficulties as these, that we may not seem in this after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>game to loose all we woon in the former.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Genius</hi> after the death of the body runs through three hazards, one respects an intrinsecal <hi>principle,</hi> the <hi>periodical</hi> terms of her vital congruity, or else the Levity and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage of her own will, which obnoxiousnes of hers is still more fully argued from what is affirmed of the <hi>Aerial Genii</hi> (whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion and fellow Citizen she is) whom sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Phylosophers assert to be Mortal; and that she is revolved hither thrice, and no more; because this number seems sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to suffice, for the purgation of sins, as you may read in my <hi>Rosie Crucian infallable Axomata lib.</hi> 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 4. at la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now whether the <hi>souls</hi> of <hi>men</hi> be <hi>virtuous or vitious, they must dye to their Aerial Vehicles,</hi> which seems a sad story at first sight, as if Righteousness could not deliver from death; but if it be more carefully perused, the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour

And a man may aswell say of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant that has left the dark womb of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that this change of his is Death, as that a <hi>Genius</hi> dyes by leaving the <hi>grosse Aire,</hi> and emerging into that <hi>Vehicle of Light,</hi> which they ordinarily call <hi>Aetheri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </q>
               <p>But let us take a more serious and distinct view of the condition of the <hi>Genius,</hi> after the conflagration of the earth; and here I meet with five several sorts of Opinions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it: <hi>The first hold, that this unmerciful heat and fire will at last destroy and consume the soul as well as the body:</hi> But this seems to me impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, that any created Substance should ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly destroy another Substance, so as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it to nothing: For no part of matter, acting the most furiously upon another part thereof, does effect that; it can only attenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, dissipate, and disperse the parts, and make them invisible; but the substance of the <hi>Soul</hi> is indissipable and indiscerpible, and therefore remains entire, whatever becomes of the body or Vehicle. Thus <hi>Virgil.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>Yet the <hi>Bodies</hi> when they die,</l>
                  <l>Are not cleer'd from all their misery;</l>
                  <l>They having not repented of their crimes,</l>
                  <l>Must now be punish'd for their mispent times.</l>
               </q>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:55271:165"/>
               <p>The second opinion is, <hi>That after long and tedious tortures in these flames, the Soul by a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al act of Omnipotency is annihilated:</hi> But me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, this is to put Providence too much to her shifts, as if God were so brought to a plunge in his creating a creature of it self immortal, that he must be fain to uncreate it again <hi>(i. e.)</hi> annihilate it: Besides, that that <hi>Divine Nemesis</hi> that lyes within the compass of <hi>Phylosophy,</hi> never supposes any such forcible eruption of the Diety into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary effects, but that all things are brought about by a wise and infallible, or inevitable train of secondary causes, whether Natural, or free Agents. And saith the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oet;
<q>
                     <l>Four things of Man there are, <hi>Spirit, Soul, Ghost, Flesh,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>These four, four places keep, and do possess</l>
                     <l>The <hi>Earth</hi> covers <hi>Flesh,</hi> the <hi>Ghost</hi> bovers o're the <hi>Grave,</hi>

                     <l>
                        <hi>Orcus</hi> hath the <hi>Soul, Stars</hi> do the <hi>Spirit</hi> crave.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The third therefore, to avoid these absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, denies both absumption by fire and annihilation; but conceives, that tedious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and extremity of <hi>pain</hi> makes the <hi>Soul</hi> at last, of her self, shrink from all Commerce with Matter, the immediate principle of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:55271:166"/> which we call <hi>vital congruity,</hi> consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a certain modification of the body, or <hi>Vehicle,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Soul,</hi> which being spoiled and lost, and the Soul thereby quite loosened from all sympathy with body or matter, she becomes perfectly dead, and sensless to all things, and as they say, will so remain for ever. But this seems not so rational; for as <hi>Plato</hi> somewhere hath <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: Wherefore so many entire immaterial sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances would be continued in being to all Eternity, to no end nor purpose, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing they may be made use of, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuate matter again as well as ever. And in another place he hath it:
<q>
                     <l>— But for their crimes</l>
                     <l>They must be punish'd, &amp; for mispent times</l>
                     <l>Must tortures feel; some in the <hi>winds</hi> are <hi>hung,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>Others to cleanse their <hi>spotted sins,</hi> are <hi>flung</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>Into vast <hi>Gulphs,</hi> or <hi>purg'd by fire.</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>A fourth sort therefore of speculations there is, who conceive, that after this soluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Souls</hi> or <hi>Spirits</hi> of wicked men, and from their <hi>Vehicles,</hi> that their <hi>pain</hi> is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to them even in that separate state,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:55271:166"/> they falling into an unquiet sleep, full of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious tormenting dreams, that act as fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon their <hi>spirits,</hi> as the external fire did upon their bodies. But others except against this Opinion as uncertain, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Soul can act when it has lost all vital union with the matter, which seems repugnant with that so Intimate and Essential aptitude it has to be united therewith; and the dreams of the Soul in the body, are not transacted without the help of the <hi>Animal Spirits in the Brain,</hi> they usually symboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing with their temper: Whence they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that there is no certain ground to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish this Opinion upon.</p>
               <p>The Souls of the <hi>wicked</hi> will be tortured (saith the fifth) in the other state, with most cruel hatred of imaginary evil, and false su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitions, and most horrible phantasmes that then fall, and there are represented to them most sad things, sometimes of the Heavens falling upon their heads, sometimes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing consumed with violent flames, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of being drowned in a Gulf, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of being swallowed up into the Earth, sometimes of being changed into divers kinds of beasts, sometimes of being torn and devoured by ugly Monsters, sometimes of being carried abroad through Woods,
